It could also show that 'The Broken Windows Theory' is a sham:

""Ultimately though, fewer arrests means fewer people behind bars, which effectively means fewer minorities and poor are incarcerated, as The Atlantic noted. That could end up improving race relations in New York City, which sparked the battle between de Blasio and the police force originally.""

Since *Seinfeld*, sitcoms have been evolving past the two-arc (A dominant, B ancillary) method that so many older sitcoms played off of (All in the Family, Three's Company, Lucy, etc.). 

Seinfeld was quick paced, witty, and introduced chaos and complicated multi-layered plots (like George lying about being a marine biologist and Kramer hitting golf balls into the ocean, boom beached whale, etc. etc.) to television audiences that made older sitcoms feel stale. Look at the sitcoms to follow--*Malcolm in the Middle*, *Arrested Development*, *The Office,* *30 Rock,* *Modern Family*, *Sunny*, *Community*, *Parks and Rec*, all are/were successful, and follow the Seinfeld model. All also appeal to a younger audience, and for the most part were/are considered edgy.

CBS as a network panders to an older audience. Shows are more formulaic (2.5 Men, Raymond, TBBT, dot dot dot) and to the average audience feels repetitive, recycled, and stale. They didn't quite evolve the same way, and that's why CBS sucks in a nutshell.  "

You had the opportunity for a real discussion, and a real chance to get your views aired to wider audience. A clever headline would have served far better than the one you chose; hyperbole sells on social networking sites, but only until someone calls it out.

You've wasted every opportunity to do something of value here; and you've drastically misplayed your hand. Sure, assuming that you're not a political marketer, Reddit messed up. The **right** answer is laugh it off, acknowledge the astroturfing problem, and continue contributing.

More detail: In the US, the death rate for 45-54 year olds in 2004 was [423.1 per 100,000](http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=587), or 0.423%. (It's lower for younger people over 1 year old, and higher for older people. For those 25-34 year old Redditors, it's 100.5 per 100,000, or almost exactly my erroneous orignal 0.1%. Cool! For 15-24 year olds it is only 0.08%) 

40% more likely than 0.423% (age 45-54) is an increased death rate of 0.169%. (Back to 0.04% for 25-34 year olds.) So there's an estimate of the order of magnitude of the increased likelihood of death. It's still small for most of us, but age dependent. For those 85+, the US death rate is almost 14%. 40% more than that is 19.6%.. almost 6% higher. There's a difference worth noting.

From what I've seen of people installing standing desks in my office, you could be more likely to give yourself a concussion adjusting the desk height than you are to prevent your death.

I'm sure (some) extreme sports have a higher increase in all-cause mortality than sitting all day.

You should get up, move around, eat right, get exercise and all that, but you shouldn't stress over sitting on your ass and not having a standing desk unless you have a lot of other risk factors. 0.04% to 0.169% is not a huge increase.

That's why we didn't have piles of dead office workers in the streets as we moved away from manufacturing and farm labor a hundred years ago.

Edit: Adding a link to [Cornell Ergonomics Lab](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html) (hat tip to harlows_monkeys), with an actual useful discussion of the ergonomics of the situation. Turns out standing desks may not be so great after all if you just stand there motionless all day. I guess there's a lot of history with factory line workers standing all day.

Edit: [greenthoughts](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/sldyp/a_study_of_more_than_200000_australians_adds_to/c4f4b3j) clarified the meaning of hazard ratio. I was lead astray by a quick search on the internet. So, the absolute risk is not something we have. However we can estimate the magnitude of it by using overall death rates, as above."

It was the Lakisha Man.",446,"The knock hung in the air for a second, and I hesitated to move. The knock repeated once more, and my heart suddenly was in my throat. I sat for another second or two, as that rotten sound reverberated around the room. This all happened in an instant. Slowly, I slid my hands backwards, getting them into a suitable position to shove myself upwards and out of my chair. My back was to the door, and as I eased myself out of my seat, I began to pivot to face the door, and the source of this hideous sound.
Just then I thought I heard another knock, but the sound quickly grew into a crash. I was promptly showered with splinters and bits of drywall as the door burst off of the hinges and the walls surrounding it also gave way. With the incredible shock of this new development, as well as the sheer force of the crash itself, I was knocked backwards onto the ground.

 I opened my eyes as the dust cleared, and sat staring at the bulbous, bleeding shape staggering into my room. Some sort of demon, was it? The blood sloshed around his transparent head, spilling out of the top and badly staining what was left of my walls and carpet. Foul demon, why have you come here?

Then I noticed his stagnant, hideous grin.

It was the Kool-Aid Man.

And he had broken through my wall.

It wasn’t blood. It was just Kool-Aid, and his body was simply the familiar glass pitcher with a friendly smile. I remembered his commercials almost at once, and just as quickly, the fear subsided and was replaced instead with incredible excitement.

“Ohhh Yeahhh!” He said, in that familiar, gruff, yet laid-back voice of his. “I got just the thing for a kid on the go like you to hydrate himself!”

He chucked a box of Kool-Aid at my head from his white-gloved hand.

“But I’m not a kid on the go…” I tried to explain as the Kool-Aid smacked my cheek and fell harmlessly to the ground. “I’m 27 years old! And plus, it’s a nuclear holocaust outside! I can’t even leave my room!”

The living pitcher just stared at me.

Ever smiling, as his sugary lifeblood sloshed around inside his head. Or was it his torso?

We continued to blankly stare at each other, my words hovering between us for what seemed like an eternity.

Vile creature!

Foul deliverer of children’s drinks!

What did he want from me?

Was this the form the angel of death had chosen? Is he finally here to deliver me to The Beast?

His horrible unblinking eyes stared, judging my soul, and I, The Last Man on Earth, suddenly felt a pang of regret for taking The Last Hit of Acid on Earth.

We sat there for twenty minutes, unmoving, not speaking. The Kool-Aid inside him eventually settled, as he stood statue-like in the remnants of my doorway. This demonic staring contest had no end.

I eased my hand backwards towards my chair over the course of this time, slithering my arm closer and closer towards the only semblance of a weapon nearby – the wooden leg of my chair. 

There was nothing I could do, after all.

It was apparent that the Kool-Aid Man had to die.

My adrenaline kicked in, and in one swift motion, with only one hand, I managed to completely tear off the leg of my chair. Screaming, I leapt to my feet, expecting some sort of reaction from my visitor. He did not move.

Filled with a sudden, divine power, I charged.

Never having learned exactly how to defeat a post-apocalyptic, hellspawned commercial spokeman, I chose the tried and true method – the stake through the heart.

I swooped in on him, and delivered my righteous chair leg through the center of his face, in lieu of the heart. The glass shattered much too easily, almost like an eggshell, leaving a gaping hole in his face. Kool-Aid gushed from his body; still he stood. I gasped, bathing in the liquid pouring from his evil figure. It was remarkably viscous Kool-Aid.

A moment passed. My hair and clothes were now dyed red from the Shower of Beverage.

He didn’t react. He just stood there as the Kool-Aid drained from his system. Still grinning; mocking me. He had to die, now more than ever.

It wasn’t until the last drop had left his head that he finally dropped to his knees. Deliverer of happiness… ever smiling. I backed away from his huge torso, and immediately, that hideous grin went slamming into the floor.

His head completely shattered. I was left with nothing but a pair of arms and legs, and a puddle of Kool-Aid so deep you could bathe in it.

I panted for a moment, relieved, and then I chucked my impromptu weapon onto his battered corpse.

Then I went into the kitchen and fixed myself a delightful glass of pink lemonade, and a Hot Pocket. They were good, but I forgot to put a plate under the Hot Pocket, and some of the filling dripped out into my microwave."

395,15248,,,,,81,"Well, the illustration was made in 2011, around the time of the announcement that the Shuttle program was ending. The picture is of a flaming astronaut walking across [6th Avenue in Manhattan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Avenue_\(Manhattan\)). The only information I can find about the illustration is this quote attributed to crossing: ""This was a concept for a band in the states, they decided not to go with it. Instead My brothers label is going to use it.""

In that context, who knows the meaning? It's for a music thing, which have pictures that rarely make sense, it seems. 

Sitting down here at my computer at one in the morning, I see the following meaning: Crossing is anguished/despairing at the recent cancellation of the Shuttle Program. He thinks that these budget cuts will separate America from her past achievements in space, specifically the lunar landings, as evidenced by use of a lunar space suit. He blames this on business and commercialism, as evidenced by the situation of the burning space suit in Manhattan. He feels that space is being ignored, and has become just another humdrum thing that people see and forget about. It's just another pedestrian in the crosswalk, and Crossing is pointing out that space is so much more. "

Turns out, they snuck into the show on a whim. 5 years later, I made friends with a guy at my university, halfway across the country from where I went to the show. He had gone to the university a few years earlier but dropped out, traveled the world, took classes at 2 other schools, and finally came back to finish his degree. We hooked up a few times and he became one of my best friends. It took about 6 months before I realized that he was the guy I had met at the Modest Mouse show. Life is odd sometimes.

We grabbed a pair of panties from a willing female friend, and dropped them in his room. Then we signed in/out a fake girl's name with the security desk so it looked like he signed someone in.

Anonymous has never been about doing good deeds. ""Freedom of information""? That had nothing to do with censorship or freedom of speech. All it really means is, ""freedom to pirate stuff"". That was what Operation Payback was all about. The RIAA hired hackers to take down websites used for piracy, so Anonymous started DDoSing the RIAA. The only other function of Anonymous was to play sick pranks on children. That is their core, their foundation, and anything they've done since has only been for recruitment and image purposes. It's all a power play. There's nothing they want more than to feel like no one can mess with them."

They are spoken pieces of story used in the edit to cover up the fact that when Actor A screwed up his line on camera, the edit can show Actor B's reaction to Actor A and use the sound of Actor B recorded ""wild"" (with no picture).  Don't record everything wild just to have it, but if you have a performance by an actor that's not that great, get the AD to take him and you aside for a little bit and deliver the lines clean so that worst case, you can use them."

Well she wrecked it and got a mini van. Those are very different to drive. The first night she got it, I decided to go do...something stupid. I think my neighbor and brother were with me. I didn't even get out of my long, windy driveway before I scratched the side door on a fucking telephone poll. The scratch was about the size and shape of my head.

When I went to park it, I realized that the scratch would be visible immediately when walking out the door. I made sure to be up when Ma was, and talked to her as she was walking out to go to work. I was fully ready for her to see the scratch and admit what happened. Somehow she didn't see what was right in front of her, and just went to work.

429,17357,Emily is useless without something of YOURs to target.,Greg is useless without something of YOURs to target.,Jamal is useless without something of YOURs to target.,Lakisha is useless without something of YOURs to target.,10.0,"Cards like Reverb/Veng/**Curse of Stalked Prey** are force amplifiers. They strengthen the cards you already have.
The reason they are bad in RDW is twofold.  

1. RDW relies on every card in your deck getting you 'Closer' to your objective. Reverberate/Increasing Vengeance/Curse of Stalked Prey all require you to have other things to be successful. It then requires a balance of burn spells/other spells in order to be effective. Reverberate is useless without something else to target. Veng is useless without something of YOURs to target. (CoSP is useless without creatures to swing after its up).  
If you get one of those cards late in the game, they can't win you the game because you might not have anything to amplify to greater strength.  
2. You don't have the resources. RDW is about efficiency. All of your spells want to be lightning bolt or goblin guide (Pretty much).  
If you have cards in your deck that make you stronger, but take you mana/a turn to cast, you might not get enough value out of it compared to running another threat or another burn spell.  
Imagine casting T1: Stromkirk, T2: CoSP, T3: Chandra's Pheonix. By the end of T3 you have: a 5/5 and a 3/3. You've dealt 6 damage to the opponent in three turns. Now the opponent stabilizes with a wrath.
Compare it to T1: Stromkirk, T2: Nothing, T3: Chandra's Pheonix. By the end of T3 you have: a 3/3 and a 2/2. You've dealt 5 damage to the opponent in three turns. Now the opponent stabilizes with a wrath.  

The difference in those situations was a minor growing buff if you're already winning. In the second scenario, you could've used a burn spell to ensure your creature connected, dropped another creature or something else. Curse of Stalked Prey takes development time.  

Going into the second part of 'Resources' is what you top out at. RDW kind of wants to top out at 3-5 lands. While you don't have the mana to Reverberate/Vengeance one of your spells, they are dead cards. They are card disadvantage, card disadvantage that might just lose you the game.  

This kind of got a bit long winded.  

tl;dr: They trend towards card disadvantage because you don't have the resources/cards they make stronger. This can cost you a game if you needed something that is cheaper/threatening on its own."

**Edit**: Maybe I should have just linked directly to this article instead. Too late now.

Lansing - House Republicans prohibited state Rep. Lisa Brown from speaking on the floor Thursday after she ended a speech Wednesday against a bill restricting abortions by referencing her female anatomy.

Brown, a West Bloomfield Democrat and mother of three, said a package of abortion regulation bills would violate her Jewish religious beliefs that pregnancy be aborted to save the life of the mother.

""Finally, Mr. Speaker, I'm flattered that you're all so interested in my vagina, but 'no' means 'no,'"" Brown said Wednesday.

Brown's comment prompted a rebuke Thursday by House Republicans, who wouldn't allow her to voice her opinion on a school employee retirement bill.

""What she said was offensive,"" said Rep. Mike Callton, R-Nashville. ""It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women. I would not say that in mixed company.""

Brown's comments were published in Thursday's Detroit News.

Majority Floor Leader Jim Stamas, R-Midland, determined Brown's comments violated the decorum of the House, said Ari Adler, spokesman for the Republican majority.

""If I can't say the word vagina, why are we legislating vaginas?"" Brown asked Thursday at a hastily called Capitol press conference. ""What language should I use?""

Brown noted ""vagina"" is the ""medically correct term.""

""We're all adults here,"" she said.

The House tabled a bill Wednesday that would ban all abortions after 20 weeks with a narrow exemption for the life of the mother after passing a bill with new regulations for abortion providers.

House Republicans also wouldn't let state Rep. Barb Byrum speak on the House floor today.

Byrum, D-Onondaga, caused a disturbance on the House floor Wednesday when she wasn't allowed to introduce an amendment to the abortion regulations bill banning men from getting a vasectomy unless the sterilization procedure was necessary to save a man's life.

""If we truly want to make sure children are born, we would regulate vasectomies,"" Byrum told reporters Thursday.

""If I say, for example, that rats can go longer without water than a camel...that would be true! But it I said that falcons can go longer without water than a camel...that would be false. If I said, however, that camels sometimes use their humps as sex-toys...well that would be bullshit"".

I've been following the site and the technical quality of the service you offer for a long time, and there have been hardly any improvements after the site went legit.

* You offer 720p video, but you use 1500 kbps bitrate for every single thing with mediocre x264 encoding settings. The result is that basically every single show on CrunchyRoll has [notable banding in the video](http://i.imgur.com/Fgg2s.png) (compare this to a [HDTVrip](http://s3.postimage.org/napro745e/streaming_quality_comparison_tv.png) of the same thing) and as someone who watches anime on a 1080p screen it is very notable and bothersome. Beyond that, I've seen plenty of encoding errors pop up every now and then, [like this one just last season](http://i.imgur.com/mKrhL.png). Can't you use variable bitrate (CRF mode in x264, so that more demanding episodes get more bitrate and less demanding episodes get less) or at least bump the bitrate up to 2000kbps and use better compression settings?
* On another note, a friend of mine (who is an audio nut) has also noted that the AAC encoder that you guys use is pretty terrible. Japanese TV broadcasts tend to have better audio quality, and their AAC encoders aren't that top-notch either.
* The subtitle renderer has hardly improved at all. Because of its limits, typesetting is also incredibly bare. I see some subbers actually try to at least rudimentary typesetting within the limits of the renderer, but most subbers don't seem to even bother and just put the sign text into some edge of the video in the same font as the dialogue. Well-done typesetting can really enhance the anime-viewing experience, so it's honestly a shame that you have to resort to illegal alternatives in order to basically get any. Compare [this](http://i.imgur.com/Zonlp.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/0zcl4.jpg) for example. Or [this](http://i.imgur.com/z9Okx.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/kxf5B.gif).
* And speaking of fonts, is there any particular reason why you stick to core web fonts and Trebuchet MS for every goddamn thing? It can't be an issue of money, since there are tons of free-for-commercial-use fonts out there that work great for subtitles. Just check out [FontSquirrel](http://fontsquirrel.com) for example. Another annoyance with CR in comparison to local file playback is the fact that if the subtitle styling on CrunchyRoll is terrible (not enough vertical/horizontal margin, font is tiny, [inappropriate threeliners](http://i.imgur.com/S9Z0e.jpg)) there is absolutely nothing that the user can do about it. With local files, I can at least change the dialogue styling to my liking.
* And last but not least, please add chapters to your videos. Considering the pathetic buffering capabilities, it would help a damn lot if you could skip past the OP/ED with 100% accuracy just by pressing a single button. This is once again a feature fansubs have offered for years yet not streaming service seem to have catched on.
* EDIT: One more thing - the quality of timing. The timing quality seems to have been quite terrible this year. Many series have the subtitles timed so that continuous lines have annoying gaps between them, which are very jarring and distracting. Scenebleeds also seem quite common. I guess one reason scenebleeds could happen is that the watermarked workraw that the translators have to work with might differ by some frames from the final video that goes up on CR, in which case I guess you'd need to educate the companies providing the video on the matter. Anyway, beyond that, especially this season (2011 Spring) the timing has had atrocious mistakes. Take Astarotte's Toy for example - many lines are split in completely awkward places, resulting in linechanges practically mid-word. There have also been mistimings where the the timer timed a line into a previous line, leaving the actual line completely unsubbed. My Ordinary Life also had the same, which resulted in one of the infamous ""?""-lines. You guys really ought to have some quality control for the people you hire for the subtitling jobs. Or just have proper quality control in general - there's been way too much post-release patching for major fuckups this season.
* There's also one thing a friend of mine has complained about - the translation of GOSICK. It seems like the translations for different episodes are done by approximately three different translators, and they're completely inconsistent in their terminology and translation ideology. One doesn't leave any Japanese honorifics into the translation (which makes total sense, since the show takes place in a pseudo-French setting), one keeps honorifics in, and one *adds honorifics in where there are none.* The last one also seems to do quite a lot of translation errors. All in all, since he's a big fan of the series, he can't help but feel very disappointed about the substandard it seems to be getting on CR.

I mean really, it's just pretty pathetic to see CR being stuck technically in the year 2007-2008 while fansubs are truly in the year 2011. I'm not even asking that much of you; I know you can't realistically reach the same level of typesetting as the best fansubs have because the CR subtitle renderer would have to be at least as capable as VSFilter/libass to achieve that (and I don't see that happening anytime soon). Get some variety to the fonts, make all the subbers do typesetting at least to the degree that can be done with the subtitle renderer, add some new features to it so even more can be done, if you can't increase the bitrate of video try adding a debanding filter to the Flash player (no idea how hard this would be to do technically, though), add chapters... At that point I'd probably stop watching the illegal releases for their better quality and just use CrunchyRoll for my anime needs. Or well, at least I'd regularly pay for a subscription and play the episodes in the background while I watch the HorribleSubs rips, since I like to watch my media locally."

&gt; ""A type of dentistry may be practiced among narwhals in that the broken tusk of one individual may be plugged with the tip of another's tusk. Although some have described this as being the result of ""head-on collisions"", this is unlikely considering the accuracy that would have to be involved (or, more precisely, the extremely low probability of such collisions occurring coincidentally). Because this ""capping"" of the tusk is unlikely to have happened by chance, it is possible that this is an altruistic act. There are accounts by Arctic indigenous people of seeing young narwhals aligning the tips of their tusks with the broken tusks of older males and, apparently, deliberately snapping the very tips of their tusks off to block open tooth cavities. A narwhal's tusk is hollow and filled with pulp and contains a sizeable nerve, which is exposed would presumably be extremely painful. One could see why this unusual behavior might develop in a social cetacean species. roken tusks have also been found with the tips crammed with sand and gravel, perhaps from an attempt to cap the broken tusk by jamming the broken tooth into the seabed.""

490,29420,,,,,-11,"&gt;idea that every male at war is a homosexual. 

At this point I realized that you are white, male and straight. Rape in prison and the army is never done by men who are in their everyday life homosexual. It is always hyper masculine stereotypical alpha males who do it to show their power over others. 

People who I have talked to that served in old Yugoslavian army would tell stories about how once someone was found out to be gay they would be beaten, bullied and humiliated until they more often than not killed themselves. Less than 5 years later this same army would go on and rape some 80% of prisoners in the concentration camps it was running. 

As for the point you and everyone else has made that we don't have statistics from medieval times on male rapes during war that is true. However we do know that for most of the period homosexuality was punishable by death. We can draw comparisons to societies where that is the case for women today: for example Saudi Arabia has one of the worlds lowest recorded rape rates, much lower than anywhere in Scandinavia for both men and women. Yet any GNO working there will tell you that it is possibly as high as one in three. I picked Africa because it is poor enough that the niceties of modern society haven't penetrated there much and war there would be closest to what medieval war looked like. However it would still be a vast improvement since the standard of living even in the Kongo is much higher than it ever was in medieval Europe/Westeros.

&gt;Rape is perfectly fine to include, but GRRM isn't dumb enough to go too overboard. 

He has a woman raped by 50 men in less than a few hours. I'd say he goes overboard whenever possible. As for Pycel being sexually rape with a broom stick and dying, his body being found with it still in, that would have been parity with all the viciously horrible things we are constantly told happen to women. Hell someone could have just said how they found him and it would have been an excellent way to show equal opportunity rapiness."

You know how many people are going to pay for a game FOR THEIR PHONE that can ONLY be played when they have a ps3 controller and TV handy. Nobody. Because that is a small fraction of the time their phone is available. For somebody that buys an OUYA they are paying for a CONSOLE. Not a phone hooked up to a TV. A console. 

The Ouya has plenty of other kool aid properties but your sole argument is the single most naive one. A console that sells 38k copies is not a huge market. An Indie game will probably only ever appeal or be seen by maybe a quarter of that. It's specs will likely be out of date by the time it's even released and since its customizable devs will have to develop for the original specs or risk not being compatible with modded ouya's. And at the moment an stable online community is a lot of money to maintain. Who knows if the Ouya team can create or afford the infrastructure to maintain that network. 

But at the same time. People want this. The XBLA has a high entry point and developing for the PSN costs a lot of money to get in. Being able to develop an android game for a console is a huge deal and if the OUYA takes off at all this will be huge for indie developers and even if it doesnt we've all just proven we want an indie console and albeit small there is a market out there if a company is willing to shell out the money. People are skeptical because they are unproven. If Sony or Microsoft or Google made this device with everything 100% identical people would eat it right up.

And again arguing your phone can do what the Ouya can do is a wasteful argument because the ouya is not trying to be your phone. It just happens to have the same hardware in a different confirguration."

&gt;He said the fed needs to create a housing bubble to keep the economy going!

Prediction, not request. 

Question: if Krugman wanted a ""bubble"", using and meaning those exact words, then [why did he call for action in 2005 when it was clear that the housing market was in, and I quote the exact term he used, a ""bubble""](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/08/opinion/08krugman.html)?

Actually, it was McCulley that first called Greenspans' bubble; Krugman merely paraphrased him. **Here is the original quote Krugman referred to**:

&gt;There is room for the Fed to create a bubble in housing prices, if necessary, **to sustain American hedonism**. And I think the Fed has the will to do so, even though political correctness would demand that Mr. Greenspan deny any such thing.""

Question: is the above speaker genuinely hoping that Greenspan will create a bubble to sustain ""American hedonism""(yay hedonism!), or making a prediction about what he'll probably do?

&gt;He said there should be a new bubble to replace the old one on Spanish TV!

Now this is getting really dishonest...**Krugman was quoting [the Onion headline](http://www.theonion.com/articles/recessionplagued-nation-demands-new-bubble-to-inve,2486/) about people looking for a new bubble**. The quote on Mises is hacked up with ellipses, and they refuse to provide the entire thing unedited. But you can read what Krugman thought of the Onion article on his blog. He sees it as a statement of the market's frenzy to find something new to throw their money at. [Here's Krugman referencing the Onion in his blog around the same time, very obviously referring to absurdity of it and not, as Mises claims, using it as a guiding economic policy.](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/state-of-the-onion/) As the person he linked to said, ""[If it wasn't so sad, it would be hysterical](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/07/headline-of-t-1.html).""

&gt;He called for interest rate cuts in 2001! That proves it!

They say he ""must"" have meant it because he called for interest rate cuts in 2001, when the economy was in a slump. They seem ignorant of the fact that both the fed and the economists that offer advice for them re-assess interest rates every 6 months or so.

&gt;Ok then, but he DID want the housing boom to drive the economy

If you take that to mean Krugman wanted a bubble, it appears to be based on a confusion between what a speculative bubble is and what an economic driver is. While they can go hand in hand, the two are different things.

In layman's terms, a ""bubble"" seems to have become synonymous with ""any big boom in the economy, which will inevitably come to an end with a backlash"". If you believe in Business Cycle theory, you're very inclined to think that, since that concept is fundamental to the theory's model of how the economy works (Boom-Bust).

But a ""bubble"" is not defined as ""bad shit that happens after seemingly good stuff happened"". A speculative bubble is defined as ""trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance with intrinsic values"".

In other words: Investors drive up the price of a good. Others, seeing the price rise, assume it must be a great investment, driving the price up even further. This cycle continues, until someone tries to sell the good at the (ridiculously overvalued) price. When people are unable to sell, the price drops to realistic levels, and all the money people had on paper vanishes. And worse, if they bought the good at the overvalued price, they're in debt with no way to recoup. (I'd like to point out that as much as Austrians worship gold, it's perfectly possible for the above scenario to happen with that good, too).

However, bubbles do not have to go hand in hand with economic drivers. It's perfectly valid for a housing boom to stimulate the economy...if houses are actually needed, and of benefit to people who genuinely need to buy them and are willing and capable of getting them at the market price. The problem is when prices move out of sync with what the market can bear. And that is where the fed can step in.

You might disagree with that, and believe that *any* manipulation in interest rates will inevitably lead to a bubble, and that therefore anyone that believes in the power of the fed wants one. But keep in mind, when you say that, you go against 100 years of mainstream economic thought, not just this guy specifically.

–profits: to the extent that the increase is paid for out of profits, we shouldn’t expect job losses. And in an economy where profits have dazzled while paychecks have fizzled, that ain’t a bad thing.

–prices: some studies find that a small bit gets passed through to higher prices.

–productivity: to the extent that higher wages reduce turnover and vacancies, a higher minimum can partially pay for itself by squeezing out such inefficiencies. It’s not wishful thinking—some studies have found just that.

–reasonable rates: it matters what the level you raise it to, and historically, increases have affected less than 10% of the workforce, often even smaller shares. With relatively few in the “affected range” we wouldn’t expect to see large distortions.

–it’s stimulus! Minimum wage workers tend to spend the extra cash, so there’s more economic activity than otherwise would occur—btw, even under the redistributive scenario described under “profits” above, you’ll get this effect if low-wage workers consume more of their last dollar than those in the sky boxes.""

One other thought... if they had run it on second down and failed, you call the time out.  That leaves roughly :22-24 seconds on the clock and gives you time to go to the sideline and discuss BOTH upcoming plays.  3rd down should be a pass, and if incomplete you still have time for a fourth down play, and that fourth down play can be a run or pass.

So there were more ways to get three plays in before time expires other than passing on 2nd down."

Choosing to step out of its way to incite others because ""they can"" or whatever absolutely is trolling. It's also going to offend 1 billion people, 99% of whom are not extremist.

What Google has chosen to do instead - publish a [""Je Suis Charlie"" badge](https://www.google.fr/) on its French home page - is far more appropriate, positive, and aligned to its brand. It shows solidarity for the victims and what they stood for without provoking further violence and hatred. Well done, Google."

* ***New York City Police Commissioner*** (1895-1897) -Roosevelt implemented regular inspections of firearms and annual physical exams, appointed 1,600 recruits based on their physical and mental qualifications and not on political affiliation, established meritorious service medals, and closed corrupt police hostelries.  Roosevelt made a habit of walking officers' beats late at night and early in the morning to make sure they were on duty.

*  ***Assistant Secretary of the Navy*** (1897-1898) - Roosevelt became Secretary of the Navy for 4 hours while John D. Long went for a message.  He quickly told the Navy worldwide to prepare for war, ordered ammunition and supplies, brought in experts, and went to Congress asking for authority to recruit as many sailors as he wanted.

* ***Colonel Roosevelt*** (1898, San Juan Hill, Cuba) - Roosevelt rode back and forth between rifle pits at the forefront of the advance up Kettle Hill, an advance that he urged in absence of any orders from superiors. He later refered to the battle as **""'the great day of my life""** (Having originally declinded the awarded, in 2001 Roosevelt was awarded Congressional Medal of Honor, becoming the first person to be awarded a nations highest honor for military valor and the Nobel Peace Prize)

* ***President of the United States of America*** (1901-1909) - Held record for most hands shook in a day until 2004 with 8,513.  Regularly boxed as Governor of New York and as President, until his sparing partner detached his left retina, blinding him in that eye.  Occationally skinny dipped in the Potomac River.

* ***Safari*** (1909) - Upon leaving the presidency, Roosevelt went on a Safari.  Roosevelt and his companions killed or trapped more than 11,397 animals.  Of these, their kills included 512 big game animals, including six rare white rhinos. The expedition consumed 262 of the animals. Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to Washington; the quantity was so large that it took years to mount them all, and the Smithsonian shared many duplicate animals with other museums.

* ***Assassination attempt*** (October 14, 1912) - John Schrank shot him, but the bullet lodged in his chest only after penetrating his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech he was carrying in his jacket. Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not completely penetrated the chest wall to his lung, and so declined suggestions he go to the hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his scheduled speech with blood seeping into his shirt. He spoke for 90 minutes. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose."" Afterwards, probes and x-ray showed that the bullet had traversed three inches (76 mm) of tissue and lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle."

Actually, ""embassador"" is an acceptable, though obscure, variant of ""ambassador."" But for a very long time it was the more popular version. Both spellings have been in use since the 14th century (Geoffrey Chaucer actually spelled it as ""embasitour""). Shakespeare used both variations. In the 17th and 18th centuries, ""embassador"" was used much more frequently. But that began to change in the 19th century.

Why? What made ""ambassador"" much more common today?

Starting in the 19th century, editors began tracing the word back to its original etymology—from the medieval French, ""*ambassadeur*"", and ultimately from the Latin ""*ambactus*""—servant. So they began to simplify things, stating that ""ambassador"" was the only acceptable spelling.

**But here is where the plot thickens.**

You see, the corruption from the Latin to the English ""embassador"" occurred among many medieval dialects and had implanted itself quite securely in the English language. So securely, in fact, that ""embassy""—the residence of ""embassadors""—had long been, even in the 19th century, the only acceptable spelling. Or, as Dr. Johnson, authority on English prose, wrote, ""Our authors write almost indiscriminately embassador or ambassador, embassage or ambassage; yet there is scarce an example of ambassy, all concurring to write embassy.""

Thus it was the case that in England, where there were more editors (being more developed than the largely agrarian America), ""ambassador"" became the common spelling, whereas Americans, while still using both, preferred ""embassador"" with the ""e.""

But eventually, the Latin bug caught its way over to America, and American editors now, for the sake of simplification, took note from the Brits and declared that ""ambassador"" is the correct version, being more closely related to the Latin. And thus, ""embassador,"" while still being perfectly correct, went out of style by the beginning of the 20th century.

Thus it is the curious case that in standard English, we have ""embassy,"" ""embassage,"" but ""ambassador."" Cool, huh?"

I can also say an older Brother mine engaged in a life of crime for about 8 years. He started on pills, moved to heroin, and stayed there for about said 8 years. He never really harmed people but did cheat, rob, and steal to get what he wanted. He was involved with a friend and was looking at 25 to life for a bogus kidnapping charge. The woman who was pressing the charges (who owed my Brother's friend money for narcotics) was discredited and the charges were thrown out. Rest assured for about 3 months I really believed I was never going to see my Brother a free man again. This all came to a head when one night after smoking sherm (pcp, wet, whatever) and doing drugs he tried driving home at 7 in the morning. He got hit, tried leaving the scene, ended up at my house with about 9 cop cars in tow. He went to jail the Sunday before Easter and was out Halloween that same year. When he went in he was 198 pounds. When he came out, his skin was shiny, teeth white, smile wide, a healthy 265, and a new sense of purpose in life. He's been clean going on 2 years now, he has 2 jobs, works out everyday, and we both go to school together. I love my Brother more than anything. That being said my Mother deeply blamed herself and my Father who wasn't around during most / all of our childhood. So to compensate when my Mother divorced my Father when my older Brother was 14 she started buying him everything. Designer clothes, shoes, cologne, his first car, all kinds of things to make up for his early life I suppose. This started his ""I can get anything I want"" attitude. He got in a car accident when he was 16 and was given percocet, and that started the monster inside. 

Edit - I should mention my Brother is well over 6'10. Also, I wrote him every 3 days (his preferred times) a letter and we kept in touch through that and phone calls every Sunday night. Since he was big like that, ran a store, and the prison was County and not Federal he was a force on the block. Total Dredrick Tatum moment as he's on the phone, you hear loud commotion in the background, my Bro: ""Yo! Shut up!"" then almost undecipherable whispering afterwards. We had a good laugh about that everytime. Also, prisons rape you on phone calls. They say they need private branch exchanges so they can record and monitor calls, at the end of the day these calls are like $3 to connect, and 75 cents a minute after that, or some outrageous number.

With Tenzin being a new father at 50, I thought it was possible for Zuko to have an older son, but it is more likely he is just a grandson.

Considering Zuko is still alive with a daughter, it is possible either he helped name his grandson or his daughter named him after Iroh to honor both Iroh and Zuko

Earthquakes are a totally different scenario from what happened at the WTC.  During an earthquake the earth beneath a building can ""liquify"" which causes the building to lean to one side before it falls which is what happened in the pictures you showed.  When the buildings did lean far enough to fall, they fell straight down from there.

I know about the [Jones paper](http://www.physics.byu.edu/research/energy/htm7.html); he and Judy Wood are as big a nut as Ward Churchhill.

720,3503,,,,,162,"your comment makes me wish that I'd focused a little more on the ""answer her questions if its genuine lack of understanding"" part.  I believe most younger women these days can make peace happily with their boyfriend's porn, if they just understand what it's really about.  But like you said, it's not intuitive at all for women to understand that porn doesn't reflect on them, and when a woman has never had her man explain to her that porn isn't about her, it's natural for her first thought to be that the porn means that he's not satisfied with what he's getting, or that he wishes he had something different.  I do wish I'd focused more on telling guys that it's important to help girlfriends understand, before jumping to the putting-your-foot-down part.

Uhm.  I'm a woman, so I'm not sure if I'm the best at explaining this.  What I do know for sure, though, is that porn is not a reflection of your boyfriend's true preferences.  The porn he looks at isn't a good way to measure what his best fantasies are or his true preferences are.  Just because he's looking at a porn star, doesn't mean he actually wishes he was with her instead of you.  She's two dimensional, has no personality or needs or feelings, she is an image that exists for one purpose only - to provide a visual so that he can get off.  He doesn't want her, he doesn't think she was real, he doesn't wish she was real, he just needs a visual image in order to fap effectively.

I guess part of this can be understood in the difference between men and women.  Men are much better able to separate sex and love, than women are.  I'm sure that lots of people are going to jump in and yell at me for stereotyping here, and yeah I know women are capable of enjoying casual sex and that sex can be very emotional for a guy...but stay with me here...sex is more often just sex, no emotional component, for a guy than it is for a girl.  A guy's reaction to sex is ""yes please"" in whatever form it takes, a girl tends to need to be much more picky.  When we see a guy looking at porn, we tend to think that it means to him what it would mean to us - that he's very attached in an emotional way to these fantasies, that these fantasies are meaningful to him.  But, they really aren't.  Sex, especially fantasy porn sex, is just not emotional or meaningful in any way at all.

But your guy loves you, and sex with you IS meaningful, and meets much deeper needs of his than just the need to get off.  You could never be replaced by a meaningless visual that leads to a meaningless orgasm.  That's just coming...but sex with you is emotionally fulfilling in much deeper ways than just the need to come.  When he orgasms, then turns off the porn, at that point the porn he was just looking at is totally forgotten and purged from his mind.  On the other hand, after he's done having sex with you, you will still stay on his mind throughout the day, because he loves you and you mean something to him.

The other key is that men are much more visual than women are.  They somehow need to actually see something sexy, in order to come.  Now if you are like most women, you're imagining something or visualizing something when you masturbate.  Men apparently can't do this, they need an actual image to look at.  Think of porn as being nothing but a tool, much like a vibrator for women.  No value to it except for an aid in getting you off.  

I guess the bottom line is, he really truly doesn't wish he was with the porn star instead of you.  He knows that she's not real, he knows that you are, and even if she was somehow real, you are the one he loves.  Men are just wired towards visuals, but it doesn't reflect on you or what he wants from you in any way at all."

There is no reasonable explanation for this sudden spurt, other than a major change in the standards for granting a mortgage or a large increase in the amount of low-cost funding available for mortgages. The data suggest that it was both.""

Spanish banks were heavily regulated but that didn't stop a huge housing bubble there either. Spain also had been artificially stimulating housing for years with pro home ownership policies.


 

Spain had a pro home ownership government policy like the US and had +100% home prices. Germany had no housing bubble. Spain was also favorable for foreign investment in housing from places like the US.

Fannie Mae also acted as a world player in stimulating housing because it was such a big share of the world market others had to loosen standards to compete. Fannie Mae dropped Mortgage interest rates by about 1% in America and that had a world wide effect. Just so you know the Value of the $6 trillion in mortgages owned by Fannie is equal to the entire Chinese mortgage market four times over. The entire Chinese mortgage market is valued at $1.6 trillion so Fannie Mae played a larger role in influencing mortgage prices than China, India, the rest of Asia, and sections of Europe combined.

761,1056,,,,,376,"Ok.  5 year old version.

Your computer wants to ask Reddit's computer for the front page.  Imagine that your request is like a person trying to fly from small town Alaska to a small town in florida.

First you go to your tiny airport (your isp) and fly to a larger on in Juno.     It may go like this.

* Tiny airport  (your computer)
* Juno
* San Francisco
* Chicago O'Hare
* Atlanta
* Tiny town in florida. (Reddit)

So San Fran, Chicago and Atlanta are major hub airports.   Like a river which grows from many streams, the traffic flows gathers at the hubs and then out to other locations.  Flights usually involve at least one major hub.  It would be impossilbe to have a flight from your tiny town to every airport on earth.  So instead you take a path to a hub.  Once there, there is a path to all other hubs, thus all other locations.  

It would be just as impossible for you to have a dedicated line from your computer to every single website on the internet.  Internet traffic flows just like the airports.  The core routers are like the major hubs.

Now imagine that Chicago O'Hare closes.  That would be major news and would cause huge ripples through the system.  However you could still get to your destination because you would be ""Routed"" to a different hub, say Salt Lake City and from their you can still get to where you are going, it just took longer because you had to be re-routed.

Now about 30,000 people per day go through O'hare.  Since they are all now being re-routed all of the other hubs get busier.  Another hub may become so busy that they stop accepting flights thus causing even more re-routing to occur.  Now all of the hubs are overloaded so they start canceling flight and putting people in hotels.  In our analogy, these are ""dropped packets"" or ""packet loss"".  

So in the link above, you are seeing three statistics for each router (major hub airport).  Index, response time, and packet loss.   Response time is anologous to delayed flights.   The higher the number the longer it takes for a packet to get to/from the router.  Packet loss represents people put up in hotels due to cancelations.  The router cannot process all of the traffic it is getting so it drops it on the floor.

So you are seeing an airport system where almost half of the major hub airports have canceled ALL flights.  They are dropping everything and the remaining routers are getting all of the load.   This probably happened in a cascade where a couple routers had a problem and the increased burdon on others caused them to also fail.  Like a house of cards toppling.

Luckily the internet traffic is traveling on protocols which can deal with such things.  Just like the airports, eventually the smaller airports would stop sending more airplanes into the cluster fuck until it cleared up.   In the same way the protocols can back-off.  This causes the originating computer (yours and reddit) to detects the packet loss and automatically start slowing down how fast they send data.  This allows such problems to self heal as the traffic on the internet will automatically decrease to roughly fit the capacity.  Then ramp back up again as things return to normal.

It's not perfect but it's fun to know that your computer is taking specific action to help the entire internet deal with such problems.

Perhaps you have heard the phrase ""The internet routes around damage.""   This is true.  You can nuke a router, or a fiber line etc and the traffic will just take another path to its destination.  (it was designed this way partly so it could remain functional in the face of nuclear attack).

Right now the internet in north america is in pretty serious pain.  All the routers, servers and computers are doing everything they can to 'route around the damage' which is why we are still here on reddit.

Hope that helps.

tl;dr That road has a traffic jam, let's go this way.  Alas, everyone going that way causes a new traffic jam.  OR  SHIT O'Hare airport is snowed in."

I don't know about The Sims, but EA had nothing to do with Spores changes, that's just bullshit. Any game the EA has touched that has been ruined was ruined by the game studios themselves, NOT by EA. You constantly hear gamers complain about big bad EA, but how often do you hear developers complain? 

I recently heard a talk by Karl-Magnus, the CEO of Dice. During the Q&amp;amp;A, when he was inevitably asked about EA, he said they basically just hand out money and let the studio do their thing, and that It was one of the best things that has happened to the AAA industry (and that that's generally how it goes with EA funded games).
Of course that's just an anecdote, but it does reflect the general attitude amongst developers. Tim Schafer doesn't like EA. but where do you think the money to make their Ames would come from in the first place if they didn't happen to have success on kick starter? 

Gamers so often complain about EA ruining their games. They need to wake up and blame the studios themselves for fucking their shit up.
Don't want day one DLC? How about no DLC at all? Don't want an accessible Spore? How about no Spore at all? Those are the choices game studios are faced with. Just be glad that there are a few of them, like Valve, who are not dependent upon all of that monetizing business, but not all studios are so privileged. And you better believe that it's a good thing EA is there to hold their hands when shit the shit hits the fan.

It's not like EA is sitting on a pile of money laughing evily. Where these people think the money that funds their games are coming from? Those money go RIGHT back into the system, supporting studios, keeping them in business.

Don't get me wrong. EA is not necessarily the guardian angel of gaming either, but they're definitely not the ones destroying the game industry. Without big publishers like EA, and without people who where focused on making money, there simply wouldn't be an industry to destroy. You can't have your cake and eat it to.

I used GNU/Linux in 2000-2004 for every day jobs, but eventually went back to Windows XP because it just did all those things equally good or better like gaming. And because I didn't really want to even be associated with Linux users because... well, let's just say they think they are on a mission and sound like it.

I tried it again later last year and while it was a lot better (Crunchbang and Mint), unfortunately so is Windows 7. So I went back to Windows 7.

Weddings are common sources of stories, both true and fictional.  Furthermore, weddings often feature a character who serves as either ""the third wheel"" or ""the interloper,"" either interrupting or attempting to interrupt the love story taking place.  Upon opening this thread, did you expect to see a story in which the pastor served as ""that which comes between""?  How do you find this to fit within the typical narrative of a love story, in which the three elements are the lover, the beloved, and that which comes between?  Like many examples of the interloper, the pastor probably considers himself to be ""the beloved.""  How would the ending of the story change if this were the case?

1. "". . . the U.S. is unique. And just as we have the world's most advanced economy, military, and technology, we also have its most advanced oligarchy.

    In a primitive political system, power is transmitted through violence, or the threat of violence: military coups, private militias, and so on. In a less primitive system more typical of emerging markets, power is transmitted via money: bribes, kickbacks, and offshore bank accounts. Although lobbying and campaign contributions certainly play major roles in the American political system, old-fashioned corruption--envelopes stuffed with $100 bills--is probably a sideshow today, Jack Abramoff notwithstanding.

    Instead, the American financial industry gained political power by amassing a kind of cultural capital--a belief system. Once, perhaps, what was good for General Motors was good for the country. Over the past decade, the attitude took hold that what was good for Wall Street was good for the country. The banking-and-securities industry has become one of the top contributors to political campaigns, but at the peak of its influence, it did not have to buy favors the way, for example, the tobacco companies or military contractors might have to. Instead, it benefited from the fact that Washington insiders already believed that large financial institutions and free-flowing capital markets were crucial to America's position in the world. . . .""

3. "". . . With the notable exception of the War of 1812, the United States did not face any significant foreign incursions in the 19th century. It contained the threat from both Canada and Mexico with a minimum of disruption to American life and in so doing ended the risk of local military conflicts with other countries. North America was viewed as a remarkably safe place.

    Even the American Civil War did not disrupt this belief. The massive industrial and demographic imbalance between North and South meant that the war's outcome was never in doubt. The North's population was four times the size of the population of free Southerners while its industrial base was 10 times that of the South. As soon as the North's military strategy started to leverage those advantages the South was crushed. Additionally, most of the settlers of the Midwest and West Coast were from the North (Southern settlers moved into what would become Texas and New Mexico), so the dominant American culture was only strengthened by the limits placed on the South during Reconstruction.

    As a result, life for this dominant 'Northern' culture got measurably better every single year for more than five generations. Americans became convinced that such a state of affairs -- that things can, will and should improve every day -- was normal. Americans came to believe that their wealth and security is a result of a Manifest Destiny that reflects something different about Americans compared to the rest of humanity. The sense is that Americans are somehow better -- destined for greatness -- rather than simply being very lucky to live where they do. It is an unbalanced and inaccurate belief, but it is at the root of American mania and arrogance. . . .""

17. "". . . The institutional structure of the United States is under stress. We might be in dangerous economic straits if the dollar were not the principal international reserve currency and the eurozone in deep fiscal trouble. We have a huge public debt, dangerously neglected infrastructure, a greatly overextended system of criminal punishment, a seeming inability to come to grips with grave environmental problems such as global warming, a very costly but inadequate educational system, unsound immigration policies, an embarrassing obesity epidemic, an excessively costly health care system, a possible rise in structural unemployment, fiscal crises in state and local governments, a screwed-up tax system, a dysfunctional patent system, and growing economic inequality that may soon create serious social tensions. Our capitalist system needs a lot of work to achieve proper capitalist goals.""

846,4061,,,,,125.0,"&gt;without being explicitly gay

As someone who includes this genre of porn in his fap arsenal, I can say with confidence that people still will call you gay for it. Except gay people.  My brother calls me a faggot for watching it, and I say, ""Ha ha. Sure dude. Whatever.""

It's a kink. That's all it is. I think it probably has different draws for different people. I see threads on 4chan where people are looking at guys who are simply dressed in women's clothing. This does nothing for me. I like them to look as feminine as possible-- whether they're regular women, trannies, robots, or crocodiles. If it's generally shaped like a woman, I will have an urge to fuck it. Period. 

I think you would see a similar market if there were porn that had normal women with a third hand instead of a vagina, or maybe a toaster made of flesh. It's just something different, you know?

I don't think it's a closet gay thing, or a bisexual thing, or anything like that (at least, I know it isn't for me). I can try to fap to a picture of a man, but it doesn't work. It doesn't turn me on. I mean, it's a dude. Where are the curves? Where are the tits? Ah, there they are, on that beautiful creature over there. My brain doesn't give a fuck that there's a package between her legs. If the pattern recognition were that strict, girls with deformities of any kind would never mate. We are programmed to be attracted to things that generally look like women. If you look at a reasonably convincing tranny and *aren't* turned on, then maybe you're the one who needs to come out. The social stigma and personal fear associated with falling under that stigma prevents people from experiencing that attraction directly, but it's there somewhere.

It's biology, friends. 


**edit:** Someone actually anonymously gave me three months Reddit Gold for this post. That was a very kind gesture, and I appreciate it immensely. Whenever I preach on this subject, I feel like I'm addressing a massive frustration. So many perfectly normal, straight guys have to deal with personal and social anxiety over their sexual identity. I know it's comforting to hear, ""It's okay, bro. It's totally not gay,"" but I would also like to emphasize that *even if it were*, there would be no problem with that. 

The sexual dichotomy, just like separate bathrooms for men and women, is a social construct. If we could get rid of the bigotry, misinformation, and general bullshit, then sex would just be sex. It's something people do because it feels good and brings us closer emotionally. It satisfies urges that are *not* socially constructed-- urges that we can only superficially control. If everyone understood this, we wouldn't have to read the news every other day about some kid killing himself because insecure, bigoted assholes at school bullied him to death over what amounts (or should amount) to a virtually inconsequential difference.

It's about freeing minds. Not just about sex, but about everything. The sooner humanity clears its collective mind from the demons of bigotry, ignorance, greed, narcissism, and  superstition, the sooner we can lay down our guns, nooses, and Molotov cocktails. Once this happens, we can all travel to the stars as one big family. "

Its sad but reading garfield anthologies obsessively was the only thing that made me feel normal and it eventually took on something of an erotic fixation.

To avoid feeling like a sicko I drew pictures of garfield with a womans(Think Pamela anderson circa 1991) body and garfields head, so that I was assured that my fixation wasn't with animals or repressed homosexuality. This garfield/pam hybrid still had the same biting wit and acerbic outlook and tended to cut herself in self loathing while wolfing down a lasagna to fill the void after sleeping with drawings of a much more handsome and muscular version of myself. These drawings eventually evolved into erotic fanfiction starring garfield and myself (In my head Garfield still has a womans body but someone reading the stories would think Im having sex with regular Garfield.) I killed off Jon in a jealous rage, I didn't touch Odie, I enjoy his companionship and don't mind if he watches.

The stories are your pretty basic wish fulfillment stuff, balanced with self loathing rants. I've been doing this near daily for years and I have a substantial amount of writing in a folder I keep buried in 8 different folders.

My girlfriend stumbled across them by accident when they came up in a search and is pretty freaked out. How can I show her I'm just a normal guy with a weird outlet for my psychological problems and not some kind of sicko?

Here is a small sample so you get the picture.

I looked at her as she lay on the floor crying, my satisfied cock dripped droplets of life juice on her toes, flaccid yet still distended, looking satisfied like a man who has just run a mile and is rewarding himself with a slice of pie.

She reached for the knife as she always did and sliced into her familiar wound, mumbling 'i hate you, i hate you'. Its your own worthless soul you hate, god hates us all and thats why he laughs, he created the world to laugh at our pain, now eat up! I kicked her in the stomach incapacitating her and as she doubled over forced a pan of lasagna down her stupid throat, she coughed most of it up but I made her lick up every last drop as she cried the tears of an empty soul I found my cock get hard from her pain and went for her ***, rubbing her blood gushing forearm into her stupid face.

Odie looked at me with a look of fear mingled with hatred but he new not to interfere, and I could tell by his doggie hardon that he didn't truly mind, she would suck him off later he knew for my amusement. I made her suck many people off, to gain friends in the community but mostly to humiliate her and destroy any self esteem she had left."

Yeah, the dude was lazy with his performances and used beat repeat and a crappy Ableton set up (who didn't know this?). He plays with CDJs nowadays like most other EDM performers.

As for this bullocks about him not really producing anything, and that there's this super secret league-of-evil-esque sound design teams that do everything ... is this guy actually serious? Or did he forget to take his meds?

There's numerous interviews with Skrillex about his production processes. The guy knows what he is talking about. This post is bad and you should feel bad.

Has this guy actually ever done any music production? For one, Skrillex doesn't have a bank of ""samples"" he uses over and over. They're called patches. Number two, getting given a bunch of patches and some drum loops and throwing them together *does not* give you a decent track, especially not something of the level that Skrillex releases.

edit: Since Everseer wants me to support my arguments, because apparently the image does this ""alot"" more than I do, here's a list of shit wrong with this theory:

**12th Planet** - Established and pretty respected artist who Sonny Moore lived with for awhile. They're very tight. You really think that someone so knowledgable would never notice something was up? You never think 12th Planet has been in the studio with Skrillex? That he has never seen Skrillex actually produce? Come on.

**Interviews** - There are quite a few interviews with Skrillex about his production process. He doesn't go in-depth and give a step-by-step tutorial on how he gets his sounds (who does?) but for ANYONE with even the slightest knowledge of music production can read over these and verify that yes he does know what he's talking about. This is one http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/interview-skrillex-on-ableton-live-plug-ins-production-and-more-510973

**Integrity of poster** - The guy claims to have ""many years Ableton experience"" but can't tell the difference between a sample and a synth patch. Right.

**Inconsistencies** - So in the last section of this guy's rant he goes on about how Skrillex supposedly kept a few of the growl patches and now doesn't use anything else because he can't make anything else, but then goes on to complain that Skrillex's newer tracks no longer have those growls, and thus is somehow proof that it was someone else making them. That doesn't even make sense.

**First of the Year** - ""This track is the last we would ever hear of the noises that got Skrillex so highly regarded"". lolwut? Are you serious? He's put out lots of new tracks that have been well received. Oh they don't use the exact same noise as he used to, and that's proof that he's a fraud? The guy relies too heavily on one sound and gets ripped on as a one trick pony, so he moves into altered sounds and now he's a fraud? 

There are zero facts in this clusterfuck of tinfoil hats and autism. I will concede that yes, he has a point on the performance factor. Skrillex was (and still is sometimes) a horridly lazy live performer. The rest of the post is absolute hogwash.

My dad thought it would be ""fun"" to stay in a 400 year old stone cabin in the middle of fucking nowhere, Europe. We (my dad, mom, myself and my best friend) left the small town we were visiting and drove for about 20 minutes through farm fields, never meeting another car or person. We eventually reached a forest, and drove down a dirt road for another ten minutes. After that, the road ended, and we walked another ten minutes down a small path to the cabin. The forest was dark and dead quiet: not a bird, or a squirrel, or anything. Total. Silence. 

The cabin had been renovated for basic necessities. There was a single lightbulb in the ""main room"" (consisting of a small table with a bench, a rocking chair, and a cast iron stove). There were two small bedrooms with old fashioned beds. There was also some ""creepy"" stuff, like those old polished mirrors, a rocking chair, an old crib, etc. Not creepy by themselves, but in that setting, yeah.

The first thing we noticed is that the door didn't lock - it didn't even close, because it was warped from age. I immediately insisted we leave, but my dad, mother, and friend blew me off, saying it was no big deal - we were in the middle of nowhere, anyway. I checked all our cell phones for a connection, but even my dad's ""international"" phone had nothing. 

It soon became dark - like, really, really dark. We were sitting around the table playing cards when an old man opened the door and walked into the cabin. He was tall, thin, and wearing a suit (really weird, since we were in a poor farm village). We all jumped up, terrified, but he said he ""wanted to say hi and see how we're doing"", in perfect English (also weird). My dad asked who he was, and he said he was a neighbour from down the road. We're like, ""Um, what road?"" and he said he lived in a farm a few miles down and wanted to know if we'd come over for dinner. It was like 10pm. My dad said no, we were fine, but the guy was pretty insistent we come over. Eventually, after much refusal, he told us where he lived and said to ""come over if we needed him"". He then opened the door and walked down the path out of view.

We were all a little weirded out, so my dad dragged the fire-poker-holder and put it in front of the door to ""lock"" it. Eventually we went went to bed: my dad took one bedroom, and my mom, friend and I took the other bedroom. I refused to sleep or turn off the light, clutching a small flashlight I had brought on the trip.

About 2am, a slight breeze picked up, ruffling the trees outside. The door started tapping, opening and closing slightly with the breeze. I was totally freaked, but kept quiet, trying to convince myself that a breeze could pick up in a deep forest. 

Then my mother woke up SCREAMING. Out of all of us, she was the least freaked out by the cabin, because she grew up in a small log cabin with no water/electricity. I kept trying to settle her but she was trembling and shaking. My dad came running in and comforted her. Eventually she said that she'd had a bad dream, but couldn't remember it, and everyone went back to bed. 

About an hour later, the light went out. Total darkness, and so quiet my ears were ringing - the wind had stopped. I went hysterical, crying and sobbing. I turned on the flashlight, but it was flickering on and off. My dad once again came running into the bedroom to comfort me. After about ten minutes, the light flicked back on. By then, I was basically whimpering in the fetal position.

My parents were trying to comfort me, saying lights go off all the time in Europe, when my dad's cell phone rang in the other room. We all froze. My dad went to answer it, and it was my grandmother from back in Canada. She was worried, and wanted to know if I was okay. 

Here's the weird thing: my grandmother had a bad stroke in 2000. She can't walk, can barely talk, forgot how to use all technology, and can't remember me or my mother. She sort of has a vague idea of who I am, but that's about it. Her caretaker then took over the phone call, terrified, saying my grandmother was laying on the floor with the phone and must have crawled to it (out of her room, down the hall to the kitchen, where the only phone is).

Now my dad was totally freaked out, too. After he hung up, he tried to call my cousins. No connection.

We all basically sat in the main room for the rest of the night. Something very large kept scrabbling across the roof, the door kept blowing open - once it actually slammed open, knocking over the poker-thing and rocking the rocking chair, to my utter terror - and weird tapping sounds kept occurring. As soon as daylight came, we walked to the car and drove to my cousins house. 

My cousins weren't remotely surprised to see us, saying everyone knew that place was haunted, and they thought that's what why we wanted to stay there. My mother quietly explained that her ""bad dream"" that night was an old man and woman living in the house, but she couldn't remember what was so terrifying about that. We asked about the man in the suit, but my cousins had no idea who we were talking about - the town only has like 200 people.

When we came back to Canada, my grandmother had no memory of calling us - not surprising, though, since her short-term memory is bad. We told her about the trip, and when we got to the cabin part, she was like, ""Wait, is this the old cabin in the forest off so-and-so road?"". When my dad said yes, she started to yell how foolish we were. 

She then explained that ""everyone knew"" that the Devil lived in the house, and had killed an old man and woman hundreds of years ago, using their bodies to wander around. Even when the Russians burned down all the villages, they refused to burn the cabin down because they were so terrified of it.

Yep.

***tl;dr***: Stayed in a creepy haunted cabin in the middle of nowhere. Weird shit happened. Read last paragraph for result.

I believe i'm missing the point, then. How is this any different from programming state machines in a mainstream OO language?

&gt; LabView

My understanding of LabView applications is that it makes transforms of audio or electronic signals fairly easy. Audio processing is not, however, a terrifically complicated problem -- plenty of highly reliable software on this problem domain has been written in algorithmic languages.

I haven't seen an office suite written in LabView. If there is one, and it's bug-free, or significantly more bug-free than other suites, please point me to it.

&gt; The fundamental claim of Project COSA is that reliability is not necessarily inversely proportional to complexity even though this is true for the algorithmic software model

Again, please tell me why this claim is valid. The only reason i was able to find boiled down to ""algorithmic software is manifestly more buggy than hardware"", which is little more than an argument by [appeal to belief](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-belief.html).

&gt; It is true that a UTM, being a sequential process, cannot be used to implement a true real-time parallel system. By definition!

Is this software expected to run on a Von Neumann architecture? If so, then i assure you that a UTM can model it. If not, then you aren't taking issue with the software process, but with the way computers work from the hardware on up. If you have a worthwhile alternative to Von Neumann architectures, then please write it up and offer it to the community.

What my issue comes down to is this: i see no mathematical difference between the system you are proposing and the system that is currently in place. If you could explain the difference in those terms, then please do.

Until then, if you can show me software of significant complexity written with this system, and prove that it's less buggy, then i'll reconsider it. For this purposes, significant complexity means user-facing software which does more than simple mathematical transforms. I offered an office suite as an example, but i'd accept, say, a web browser, or even a typesetting system that arrives with fewer bugs than TeX.

""Early this morning we broke the news that Electronic Arts planned to close down Pandemic Studios, laying off 200. Now we have confirmation.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_Studios

In February 2009, their office in Brisbane, Australia was shut down. In November 2009, Electronic Arts cut a total of 1500 jobs which affected various studios, including a complete shutdown of Pandemic. On November 17, 2009, EA officially confirmed Pandemic Studios' closure, laying off 228 employees. EA absorbed 35 Pandemic employees to support The Saboteur and an unannounced project which was later revealed to be Mercs Inc, a sequel to the Mercenaries series.

Also, since football is played in bursts with highly specialized positions and formations, it is extremely tactical. The skill of coaches and players being able to reading the other team's intentions is placed on a premium compared to other sports.

Baseball is also the most technical sport. Throwing, catching and hitting are skills that are 90% finesse/training, 10% physical ability. As a child of Korean-American immigrants I grew up playing all three. Soccer is my favorite sport out of the three, but I still love football and baseball. "

Yes, amateurs often rail at the claims other amateurs make.  You'll never see a respectable, experienced CS geek say much about OO, because it's mildly useful, and not that big a deal.

When someone discovers a silver bullet, they're a highschool sophomore, and you shouldn't be listening to them.  That does not, however, reflect poorly on the thing they're talking about.

You aren't heretical: you're part of the five year backlash at the fad from five years ago.  In two years there'll be another you being ""heretical"" that Ruby is kind of lame, and that domain specific languages aren't that big a deal.  Another year or two out, and another you will discover that Haskell just isn't that important, and that for all their usage of the largest words they can find, they aren't really all that smart.  Design patterns are also being berated by ""heretics"" (amateurs) who listened to other amateurs claiming they were Jesus Juice, then still couldn't finish their projects, and assumed that meant that the Jesus Juice, rather than they themselves, were the failure.

A year after that, and several people will scientifically determine that the functional languages that we started with in the 1950s, moved past in the 1960s, and that everyone fell in love with in 2007, aren't actually higher expression or lower defect, and were moved past for a reason.  After that it'll be the cloud, then APIs, then SOAP.  XML every three years.

Et cetera.

This is nothing new.  You've unearthed the vague, boring stupidity of your recent, novice peers.

Thanks for announcing your heresy on the stuff that the rest of us had worked out in the 1960s.

Read a book.

&gt; When I raise these points I often get the answer: You can't write really large applications without OOP. I haven't been involved in the development of multi-million line applications

Neither have the people you're asking.

&gt; These are giant multi-million SLOC projects that don't use OOP and continue to improve every day.

Hilariously, one of the germinating reasons for BSD was to move to object oriented principles; the Unix Way is deeply object oriented; Linux is firmly object oriented; Windows has been object oriented for more than 16 years now both in design and in the languages used; et cetera.  All three of your examples are built on completely false assumptions that show that you know either very little about OOP, about the three projects you named, or most likely, both.

Please stop pretending to know what you're talking about.  You're just giving some idiot five years from now a reason to ""be heretical"" and discover that OOP actually is a pretty decent tool.

&gt; Then there's the problem of the object relational impedence missmatch.

Beanie hat, barbeque-sauce stained t-shirt and knee pads.

I don't know whether it's funnier that you used that phrase without knowing what it means, or that you can't spell 50% of the words in that phrase.  

&gt; Moreover, all the commercial OO code I've seen is structurally very poor.

Ah, so if you've only ever seen bad object oriented code, I can see how in turn you would think you know enough about OOP to comment on its utility.

Similarly, since I've never been to Spain, let me tell you about its people.

&gt; So if I'm wrong, why am I wrong?

Not enough disk space on reddit, but basically:

1) You don't know what you're talking about
2) Your examples are based on wrong, made-up data
3) You're dropping big phrases to sound smart
4) You're arguing with positions no respectable engineer has ever taken
5) You've never done any of this stuff yourself
6) You assume the reason you're having difficulty is ""all the levels of indirection"", when having all those levels of indirection is a classical sign of someone misusing tools because they heard it was the OOP way to go about it
7) You've never used the phrase ""I don't know""
8) You build arguments about things you openly admit you haven't done, don't know about and have never seen done well
9) You apparently don't understand that #8 is why you shouldn't have been speaking in the first place
10) You appear to be waiting for someone to sit down and counter-prove a bunch of life examples that you haven't made available for counter-proof, which are generally of the form ""mine was hard to work with and I never saw anyone else do it well""

The best part is that you probably can't actually name a large application that isn't object oriented.  The worst part is that you assume things aren't object oriented because nobody ever said they were and you cannot imagine not knowing a thing, so you're just going to rattle off a list of other large products and assume they're also not OO.

&gt; What am I missing?

Almost everything, really.

&gt; From where I am sat,

From where you sat, you don't do it well, you don't know what projects do, you've never seen it done well, you don't know what it's for, and you can't imagine why that isn't a reason to not pretend to be an expert on the topic.

The problem is that it really does contradict the central promise of Obama's rise.

Many Americans still do want to see a Washington that's more civil and unified, and so it's not totally clear how Obama's openly anti-Republican strategy will play out.

&gt;This ""potential discovery of the Higgs"" is anything but I'm afraid. I've had a read of the paper, and there are a few things that are important to note here.

&gt;1: It's an ATLAS COM note, which is meant to be internal to the ATLAS experiment and has absolutely _no_ peer review. Anyone in ATLAS can write a note like this, and it could be total bullshit. The next stage in the process is to write an internal note, which is put under somewhat more scrutiny by the collaboration prior to turning it into a publication if it's considered good enough to do so

&gt;2: The person heading up this note, Ms. Wu, is famous both inside and outside ATLAS for spamming vast amounts of notes out in the hope that one of them will be of some merit. She's hell-bent on finding the Higgs in the way that Rubbia was in finding the W boson back in the day. Sometimes people sacrifice good physics for the desire to get the prize. She ""found"" the Higgs at the LEP experiment at 115GeV in the gamma gamma channel as well, but this discovery was ruled out then too.

&gt;3: The analysis is flaky to say the least- they don't model the background at all, and merely fit to the distribution shape. In QCD backgrounds are very important. That bump could come from anywhere, either a detector, trigger or physical effect arising from a background distribution they don't understand

&gt;4: If the bump genuinely is a particle, it is _NOT_ a standard model Higgs. They find about 30 events in the peak, which with the data we have now is much too many to be a Higgs- it would mean the number of Higgs produced is about a factor of 10 or more larger than the Standard Model allows for. We'd have seen it in the US Tevatron experiments, and maybe even at LEP if it was produced as copiously as this. What it _could_ be is something new and non-standard model. If it is that's amazing, but again it's hard to imagine something that only appears at LHC energies and not at those of the tevatron in such copious amounts

&gt;5: This has caused a massive shitstorm in ATLAS because internally everyone knows it's shit, but it leaked within about 10 minutes of being circulated internally and the press/bloggers have jumped on it like it's evidence that god exists, elvis has returned from his trip to mars, and flying pigs use antigravity to get around.

&gt;The party line from the experiment is ""This is not an official ATLAS publication"". The general feeling is that the backgrounds need to be understood, the analysis needs monte-carlo simulation to back it up, and that the group who produced these results should have put a lot more effort into the publication before spamming it and claiming ""first post"".

&gt;I should put a huge disclaimer here: I'm not a member of the ALTAS collaboration, though I do work at CERN. My speciality is not Higgs physics, so my understanding of this only comes from a general particle physics background. Any opinion I express here is my own and not for republication."

Rob's point is that by allowing these fantasies to be indulged they are more likely to occur in the real world. Now we have both the actual rapists gloating, and a new generation that is emboldened by their online network of sex offenders.

&gt;THANK YOU, yes I did find two girls 1 cup disgusting. As you can tell what I am attracted to is the struggle and subsequent relief not scat itself. The struggle was entirely lacking in 2g1c, it was obvious the girls took laxatives and stool softeners beforehand cause it came out like soft serve ice cream. The ideal bowel movement for me to watch would be ones where the stool takes a ""comet"" formation wherein the bulk of the mass and roughage is located in a large ball at the front that they have to struggle and stretch out their anus to pass and the rest erotically wriggles out like a rubbery/slimey snake. It would be incredible to be able to have a slo-mo tape of a girls contorting struggling and finally relieved elated face as the comet head passes and the snake wriggles out. Anyone who has watched the end of a sybian video where the girl cums sighs, laughs, and staggers around rubber legged knows what I am getting at. Right now the only thing close to scat porn I watch are analacrobats.com type videos, that use bouncy balls and rubber spiky nerf type balls etc. Most scat vids give you disgusting closeup views of her anus as the shit comes out, I don't wanna see that. They really should make movies where neon colored hot cake batterish bags of paste (with chopped peanuts for roughage) are emptied into a girls anus and left to congeal and she then has to force it out and rub it all over herself. (She would take a pre video colonic to ensure no actual scat) My ideal video would be a lesbian orgy vid where a girl has a pound or two of skittles funneled into her ass which she then shits into another girls asshole (the other girl gaped herself with a huge buttplug) who then shits it into another girl, etc. etc. I'm thinking Lexi Belle, Bree Olsen, Sasha Grey, Stoya, Gianna Michaels, Faye Regan, Chapel Waste, Aurora Snow, Alexis Love, Tanner Mayes and Jenna Haze.

Pretty sure this will get buried in the comments, but I'm a divorce attorney. I would suggest you contact a lawyer licensed to practice in your state. You're getting a lot of bad advice on what to do on this thread, and you really should present your concerns to someone who knows what they're talking about. 

**Edit:** 

**Wow. I guess it didn’t get buried. After reading some of the below comments, I thought I come back and address some of them.** 

I understand that the OP came here to vent, not for advice on a divorce. However, a lot of the comments seem to go in that direction. I hope that for the OP and his family’s sake that this is just a simple misunderstanding and everything will be cool after he and his wife address this issue. I believe that the best course of action is for the OP (or anyone faced with this kind of situation) to talk about it with his wife. Not only is civil communication the key for making any relationship work, it’s also very important to an amicable divorce (should the situation devolve into one). One of the things that I try to make all my clients with children understand is that divorces only rearrange families, they don’t actually dissolve families. Even after the divorce, the parents will still have to maintain a functioning relationship for the sake of their children.

Next, to the legal issues: Let me begin by saying that I am most likely not licensed to practice in your state. Nor do I know all the facts relevant to the OP's current situation. This is not legal advice. However, I have noticed some comments that, if followed, could get the OP into trouble down the road. Here are some issues to keep in mind and discuss with an attorney:

1. The most important thing I think the OP needs to understand is that most, if not all, states have privacy laws. I imagine that the thing that OP wants most right now is definite proof, one way or another, as to whether his wife has committed adultery. OP should either discuss ways to get proof of this with an attorney or a licensed private investigator. If OP goes off half-cocked playing Sherlock Holmes, not only may any evidence he gathers be inadmissible in court, but he may also inadvertently commit a crime or a tort (money damages). DON’T HACK INTO ANY OF HER ACCOUNTS!!! In my state, it’s a crime to look at someone’s account without their permission, even if they left it open.

2. The other most important thing is to be extremely careful about moving your assets. You should not do this at all without consulting an attorney, an accountant, or someone of the sort who is licensed in your state. I believe that the comments are suggesting (and the reason OP may want do it) that this should be done as a preventative measure. However, I cannot stress enough that this needs to be done in the proper legal manner! Otherwise, you can get yourself in really deep shit down the road. 

3. Don’t listen to anyone saying that you should kick your wife out of the house until you talk to an attorney and find out if and how you can do so legally. Illegally evicting someone from their home may be a crime and may leave you liable for money damages.   

4. Don’t take your kids away or refuse to let your wife see them. Not only would doing this be used as unfavorable evidence in a custody hearing/trial, but it may also be a crime in your state. Also, only assholes do this.

5. Don’t talk shit about your wife around your kids. Don’t try to be their favorite by making her look bad. If you do it may be used as evidence against you in any custody hearings. Remember: THE KIDS ARE NOT WEAPONS TO USE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER!!! Again, only assholes do this. 

6. Document everything! Keep a diary of everything that occurs between you and your wife (unless it makes you look bad). Preserve the text message and any documentation that proves that you were out of town when whoever it was stayed the night. 

7. Kind of related to the last one: Despite what the others say, Adultery MAY actually be relevant even if your state is a no fault state. My state is a “no fault” state, but evidence of adultery is admissible to block alimony when the adultery was the cause of the separation. Also, it may be relevant to custody if the kids were in the home at the time the adultery occurred. 

Finally: TALK TO A LAWYER! Even if you don’t go through with a divorce, a licensed attorney in your state will be able to advise you of the best course of action. A lot of attorneys do a free consultation or an initial consultation for a couple of hundred bucks. 

**TL;DR My ultimate advice to the OP: Talk about this with your wife openly and honestly. Even if she hasn't cheated on you, your suspicions will eat away at you and pollute the marriage. Secrets destroy marriages.**"

Monolayer graphene (one sheet) has quite different properties to bilayer graphene (two coupled sheets).

Trilayer graphene has also been looked at; depending on the stacking variation (ABC or ABA), its electronic properties are like a monolayer and bilayer combined.

All these are of current theoretical and experimental interest, as their physics is different to bulk graphite.

The more layers you have, obviously the closer you come to having physics that is well understood, that is physics of graphite."
1049,18690,,,,,35.0,"&gt;You're at the store, standing in front of the potato chip display. Which bag do you buy? I know you're not checking the price on each. You have a favorite. A preference.

Actually, I usually try to buy something that I haven't tried before.  Yes, I have a preference, but that preference is based on a large sampling of similar products, not on the brand.

And yes, I **do** check the price.  Half the time, I end up buying whatever is on sale.  Store-brand potato chips on BOGO?  Score!

&gt;Don't try to act ""superior"" because ""marketing doesn't work on [me].""

1. It was not my intention to come across as ""acting superior"".
2. Marketing has less impact on me than on the average person simply by nature of the fact that I am exposed to almost no marketing.  Here's another place where I'll likely be accused of ""acting superior"", but I no longer watch normal TV, so I'm not exposed to commercials.  Further, I use AdBlock when browsing the web, so I'm spared web ads, too.  The result is that I'm just not marketed to to the same degree as the ""average person"".

&gt;Choosing products based on the product itself is exactly what brand loyalty is

Huh?  Choosing products based on the **brand** would be brand loyalty.  Choosing product based on the **product itself** is kind of the opposite of brand loyalty.

&gt;Somewhere along the line, one soda brand ran an ad to make you think their product is superior.

Negative.  I judge soda based on taste (and sometimes price).  I have preferences based on flavor, not on brand, which is why I frequently purchase generic soda.  It tastes about the same, and costs way less.

&gt;You're not superior, you're not smarter, STFU and go home.

Neutropenia was my absolute Lakisha during chemo.",317.0,"I JUST YESTERDAY finished my chemo routine for non-hodgkins lymphoma. And I can honestly tell you as a recent patient several things: 


His tastebuds will change temporarily. I suddenly thought many things were very bitter. Coffee, my number one staple drink, I couldn't even touch or smell for some time. Beer, tea, anything with a 'bitter' taste, was awful. I couldn't stomach it. A lot of food also changed in taste for me. I lost my appetite and quickly lost weight. Don't bug him about eating, but maybe offer him something once in awhile. Sweets even if you have to. My doctor actually told me eat junk food, or anything -- pints of hagen daz, snickers, whatever, just to keep my weight up. Maybe buy some of that 'for yourself' but let him know he's free to take some. I found sweets were much more appealing than a lot of normal food during my 'strange tastebuds' phase. Smells can also be funny. Some people apprently smell food and lose their appetite for it for a very long time after cancer because they got sick from the smell. So just be aware about cooking really odorous foods.

**EDIT:** about the weird, persistent taste he might experience. Sometimes people call it 'metallic' but it's more like...not sure. But not cool. -- I found pickles knocked that shit out. Biting into a lime or lemon helps too momentarily, but no, eat a damn pickle. 100x better effect. 
 



**=======VERY IMPORTANT BIT ABOUT NEUTROPENIA=======**

Make sure a thermometer is in the apartment. If his temperature goes too high, some doctors say 100.5, some say 101.0, then he should call the doctor or head straight to urgent care. This is if he has [Neutropenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia), which is a condition of lacking your neutrophils, which are the white blood cells that fight off infections. I don't know what cancer he has, but this is a possibility from either the cancer itself or the chemo treatments. A very simple infection that you might fight off can be fatal for him. His body has NO WAY to fight it off. Thats why a tempertature of 100.5 or 101, which may be a *'oh I need to lay down in bed for the day'* for you, is a *'I need to go to the hospital NOW before this escalates'* for him. They will hook him up to an IV with saline. The influx of fluids will help regulate body temperature, and they will probably give him a course of antibiotics, possibly something strong like cipro to make sure they get whatever is causing the fever. 
 


Neutropenia was my absolute BANE during chemo. Chemo regiments destroy your immune system. As I said, I had non-hodgkins lymphoma, which is a cancer of the immune system, so this exacerbated the issue for me. (Severe is ANC &lt; 500, I was at &lt; 40 twice). Both times I got that low, I spent a week in the hospital on heavy antibiotics and under very close watch. 



I was also neutropenic (but not at those record lows) almost every 2nd week after treatment. I had a treatment once every three weeks, and the first week I was generally OK (or slowly getting worse) and then the **7th-14th days I felt like I had the flu and had to sleep a LOT. Don't bug him too much, let him get his sleep if he needs it.** Remind him to take his temperature to be safe if he's neglecting it and has been neutropenic before.



Basically if he becomes neutropenic the most important thing is just **BE CLEAN. VERY VERY CLEAN.** Dishes, everything, etc. Remember to clean up after yourself. Be careful about pets, especially outdoor ones. If you have a cat, don't let it come indoors and drag dead birds/mice presents for you. Not cool. Also be careful about having a lot of people over. The most people that visit and carry germs in that they've been picking up throughout the day, the more risk the interaction carries. So if you want to see friends it might be better to go out to see them and let your buddy be, unless you friends are willing to take a good hot shower and clean up before coming over.



Invite him out on his good days, but seriously let him be on his bad days. Especially if he's neutropenic. Let him be, don't risk him getting sick or eating bad food. It's not worth the hospital stay and the bills.

**=======END OF VERY IMPORTANT BIT ABOUT NEUTROPENIA=======**



He may vomit. He should get prescribed anti-nausea medication for it though. He may get diarrhea or stuff like that. He might need moist wipes but be unable to get them and afraid to ask for them. (some of the rougher chemo aren't too friendly with your insides. Dropping a deuce is a unfamiliar pain).



**HE NEEDS TO STAY HYDRATED. DO BUG HIM about that. IT's MORE IMPORTANT THAN EATING.** Particularly if he has a large tumor. As the chemo breaks down the growth, his body has to process not only the chemo drugs out of his system, but the tumor as well. This is rough on the kidneys and liver. Staying hydrated will help prevent kidney failure, kidney stones, and other complications. If he becomes a recluse and doesn't get out of his room or whatever to eat much, maybe suggest he at least keeps drinks nearby at all times so its not 'effort' to drink water. **Don't 'tempt' him with liquor or beer, its just more stress on his organs, and he's already processing more hardcore shit than shitty pbr.** A beer or two is okay, but really, don't push it at all. It's not worth it. I currently as I type this have 8 bottles of water, 2 gatorades, 3 vitamin waters, and an orange juice at my desk that I drink and then replace constantly throughout the day. 



*(Remember I just finished my chemo, so I still have 3 weeks of 'recovery' from my last treatment. That means this one week I will be crashing, 7th day to 14th neutropenia, and then a third week of my immune system building itself back up.)* 



The hair loss thing is a big deal for some. I thought it was funny and proceeded to pull chunks of my hair out. It was fascinating. Wait to see how he reacts and then just go with the flow on that one. Buy him a hat or something as a gesture would probably be nice even if he decides to not wear them.  You could buzz/shave your head too, A few of my friends and my younger brother did that. It was nice, but a bit weird getting used to as well.



Depending on the type of guy he is, he might bitch about the pain of the blood draws etc. Humor him. I didn't have much trouble with this stuff, but while I've been getting my shots I've seen some grown men be VERY childish about getting certain shots. I will say at first I hated the blood draws, my first experience was a vasovagal and I nearly fainted because of anxienty of the needle in the crook of my arm. I got used to it quick though. He might have bone marrow biopsies which they stick a pretty big needle into your hip, crunch the bone inward with force, and then you experience a very odd tearing and suction of your bone marrow. Some people find this pretty painful. Anyway, the point is, he might be complaining about things like that, or he might not. Either way he's bound to experience some unpleasant crap that you just need to be aware of. He might be in a shitty mood from some of it, or he may take it all pretty well. That's up to you to find out as his roommate and act on. 



**If you got a separate toilet, use it.** For the first couple days after chemo, **he's very toxic, and urine, feces, etc is pretty dangerous for you.** Same with his clothes if he's sweating on them. He does his own wash. No mixed washes. 

Buy Lysol wipes, good cleaning stuff materials and gloves, and make sure the bathroom is clean for your own safety if you only have one bathroom. 
 

Anyway, for the most part I suppose I just gave you health issues to be aware of. But I hope it helps. As far as your attitude goes, just be yourself. Show some concern, but don't smother him in it. Let him know you can help out however he needs and to not be afraid to ask for anything. His attitude about the issue will be how you have to base your attitude on it. He may want to ignore the issue and 'be normal' he may want to tell you everything and like some sympathy. 



He'll appreciate your offer and if he decides he needs it, he'll ask for it if he's the type. If he is more of the 'I'm okay type' you might have to use your judgement. Out of all of this though, I sincerely hope you take the neutropenia section to heart.

So, Tim (because it's that mother fucker's name), left and when I looked for my money it wasn't there. I called him to ask if he'd seen me place it somewhere else, whatever. Benefit of the doubt and all that. He has no idea.

Well, the more I think about it, the more I'm sure he took it because there's just nothing else that could have happened. So I call a girlfriend, we get in my car and drive over to his mom's, which is where he lived. She had no idea where he was but when I asked if he'd ever stolen money before she just sighed really deeply and asked how much. I told her that it was over 2000 dollars, money for my education. So she searched her whole house including all his ""favorite places"". Like in the toilet tank. She tells me he's on probation and has to be home at a certain time, which was the first I'd heard about it.

So friend and I talk about it and we decided to wait at the house until he gets there and confront him. He's with a friend, gets out of the car and we start arguing in the street, with him insisting he knows nothing about it. I'm getting more and more pissed, starting to threaten to call the cops and stuff. Just as things are starting to get heated, another car drives down the street and stops very suddenly in front of his house.

These two chicks get out and I hear Tim say ""oh shit"". This girl with 2 inch deep black eyeliner, homemade tatoos and a mohawk walk over to me and says, ""Hi, I'm Tim's girlfriend. Who are you?"".  I'm getting worried at this point because I'm not a fighter at all and I know she could beat my ass if she wanted to.  So I opt for the truth. I tell her that I've been seeing Tim and that I think he's stolen my money.

Tim is about 10 feet away from us; he's been kind of inching towards the house. She turns away from me, walks right up to him, punches him in the face as hard as she can, turns around, gets in the car with her friend and leaves.  I found out later through a mutual friend that they had met at rehab and that he had told her she was the love of his life or some shit. She'd gotten out of rehab *that fucking day*. 

So he's standing there with a bloody nose and I tell him to give me the money now, or I'll call the cops. So he pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and tells me he's already spent 60 of it on pool and beer, but I'm happy to get that much back and just ask him why he would do something like that to me. He says ""because I could"". 

And I don't see him again until many years later when I'm working at a coffee shop and he comes in with another girl that was sort of in my group in HS. I give her the very short version of the story and find out he's done time, has been to rehab several times, has kids with god knows who...but he's changed and she loves him!  I didn't even try to talk her out of it. I figured she'll learn soon enough. 

Seriously, though, I'm really glad I had that experience at 19. It's saved me a lot of heartache by teaching me not to give my trust to anyone that hasn't earned it.  I am very careful now."

First, there was the outrage about Zoe Quinn getting preferencial treatment in the media when the Zoe post came out, presumably because she was a woman. Gaming media sites had no problem writing articles speculating on the Max Tempkin or Brad Wardell stories that contained alleged sexual misconduct, but discussion of Zoe Quinn's affairs were completely ignored and discussion was expunged and moderated out (might even call it censorship).

So at first GamerGate was upset with the media basically for being sexist; they did not hold Zoe Quinn to the same standards as the men they would report on. Instead they gave her a free pass and did their best to cover the whole thing up. And a lot of Gamers raged about it, in very threatening ways. They demanded that this injustice was proof of corruption, and they made their voices heard. GamerGate would eventually come around to the idea that it was not because Zoe was a woman that she was getting prferencial treatment - she was on the inside of a larger clique in gaming journalism. It wasn't some kind of misguided sexist double-standard (although some argue this was a motivating factor), it was just plain nepotism. We can see this in the leaked GameJournoPros emails where a few big names in the journalism scene got together to give her an aid package. And there is evidence of collusion in things like the IGF.

But by then the damage was done. The gameing media formulated its response and decried the GamerGate crusade as inherently sexist. Every major gaming publication came out with the infamous 'Gamers are dead' articles. Obviously this was not to say that gamers were dead, but that the ""old gamers"" (white, sexist males who were entitled and used to having things their way) were being replaced by a more diverse, more ""good"" type of gamer (an influx of progressive female and minority voices). It wasn't that game sites were unethical or had sexist double standards or even colluded with one another; it was that ""old, bad gamers"" were just mad that they were dying out and being replaced.

What this has done is create a divide between ""good gamers"" and ""bad gamers,"" and so GG is basically a label to throw onto the ""bad"" gamers. You can see this in the other reply to your post by /u/GatePleb, who talks about ""the good side of gaming in Zoe and Anita.""

I don't think GamerGate is the only thing at fault for the negative media portrayl of gamers; there were numerous stories before GamerGate of how gaming, and by extension gamers, were part of a sexist culture. Anitas first video was before GamerGate, gamers unhappy with ME3's ending were labled entitled babies, Dragon's Crown's Sorceress art had a lot of ""this kind of art is sexist, dont buy this game"" discussion (even though the game was actually quite good), and God of War Acension was docked points by Adam Sessler for the achievement ""Bros before Ho's"" as evidence of misogyny in gaming. The #1reasonwhy campaign. And the Max Tempkin and Brad Wardell stories of course. The list could go on, and all of these helped create the narrative that ""old"" gaming was rife with sexism and misogyny. A lot of gamers were already upset by these stories, which would lead to GamerGate being so explosive.

So who do we blame for the division in gamers? GamerGate for accussing major game sites having some kind of double-standard regarding sexism and nepotism (which they call a lack of ethics), or game sites for branding the ""old gamers"" as white male sexists (which is really just not true)? The way I see it, there's some truth to both of those things.

I begged and begged and then finally my father took me shopping for the perfect mouse. I named him basil and he was a cute little fucker. But poor little basil needed lots and lots of play time which I couldn't give. So I bought him a female friend. He became a rapist over night. And would like to chew on her ears. So I thought to myself. Maybe another mouse will help. So in goes another female the following weekend. I let two female mice get repeatedly raped by (this time he was obese and lazy, except when he got his little mouse hard on) Alpha Mouse. Confused and angry at him. He didnt listen to me nor did he stop. So I managed to get my father to buy me a big ass fish tank. Maybe two metres in length, one metre high. And separated the tank with two inch thick cardboard. Too late, they were pregnant. Anyway, a couple weeks later I had too many baby mice (fuck they jump high!) and Mr Basil chewed his way through the cardboard and was a shitty father to the baby mice. I didn't want them to get pregnant as well... 

I got home from school one Friday afternoon and I noticed my catholic family of mice were all gone! Except for basil, he even had the whole fish tank to himself. My mother gave me around $30 and said that she sold them all to the pet shop for $1 each. I was stoked. First of all, I had $30 and second, they were all going to go to lovely homes.

Fast forward twelve years: It was Christmas and we were laughing at the time I hand delivered 28 odd baby mice, and my lovely mother dropped the bomb that she had put them all in the freezer to die. 

TL:DR Had too many baby mice, my mother said she sold them, she actually put them in the freezer to die 'peacefully' in their sleep."

Last night I saw this story briefly, in a title only. It said something 'bizarre theft of pagan statue' or something. So we can see the media is treating it as a joke since the title should have mentioned the note or the cross put in its place. Carberry is completely correct- this is very much a hate crime, and nobody is treating it as such. I hope the issue is taken seriously so whoever is responsible might realize they aren't untouchable just because they're Christian. "

1164,22656,,,,,2.0,"For some numbers like 1/3 or 0.333333...etc. and similarly repeating numbers  it is infinity.  To help understand that one you can try dividing 1 by 3 by hand (i.e. long division) and you'll see how there is no way that this sequence will ever end.  Pi is the ratio between a circle's circumference to its diameter and it is non-repeating and according to wikipedia non-ending.  Understanding how pi is non-ending is a bit more complicated but it can be understood through the proof that pi is irrational.  Based on Lambert's proof that pi is irrational (see the wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational), it can be shown that pi can be expressed as a never ending series and therefore it itself is a never ending number.

I have a fast metabolism but that is beside the point. Here was the day- wake up, get small styrofoam cup of puffed corn (I think thats what it was), along with a milk and a super small watered down apple juice. Every 3 or four days this would be substituted for two hardboiled eggs and a bananna. Lunch- normally about what I would eat for breakfast nowadays, some soggy veggies and a sandwich. Supper--- oooh the big one, usually about the size of a normal lunch. Lunch and dinner also came with a 3 inch square cake most days. I fucking starved, they expect you to buy more food from canteen. One guy I was with was allergic to the chemical they put in turkey which makes up all the kinds of ""meat"", he went for two weeks only getting cheese and peanut butter sandwiches substituted for every meal. For the first week he only got cheese, everyone shared their food with him because he literally was going insane from lack of calories as he also didn't buy canteen. It's insane how much better people get it in prison compared to people in jail who usually just stole something from a store or never paid a fine or drove drunk. 

Edit:By sandwiches I mean two pieces of ultra white bread stuck together with the least amount of peanut butter/cheese as possible. It is so filled with air that the cheese or peanut butter seeps through both sides making it seem soggy also."

I can't see how any of those investments really matter.

There is just not coherent plan here. Handing out grants is nice, but cutting millions off from education because they can no longer afford tuition kind of ruins the whole idea of handing out more grants.

A more realistic approach would be to work on lowering tuition costs not funnel huge sums of money to colleges and corporations. 

Well of course Bush isn't anti science, but his investments are mostly stupid when you go actually look at them one by one. More importantly they are all just token investments not meant to ever produce anything. 

Do you understand? He is appeasing the need for science grants, but he has no plan nor is he asking for any real return. It's just money being thrown around without a vision.

In a time like this we don't need random science investments. We need a path to follow to lower energy costs and lower health care costs. We need sciences that specifically lower costs, increase production and focus dramatically on efficiency. 

But what we are getting is robotic drones and transport trucks, inferior body army, and vast underinvestment in alternative energy to keep up the guise of progress.

But cmon, Bush is a oil man, he isn't going to commit in any way that changes the paradigm of profit. He'll push useless military tech which we'll never see a dime from. He'll make wide investments guaranteed to produce few results. His investments are unfocused and random because they are not goal oriented, they are favor oriented.

On the right side of the track there is a single railroad worker, Lakisha, who will definitely be killed if the brain steers the trolley to the right.",36.0,"Consider the following case:

On Twin Earth, a brain in a vat is at the wheel of a runaway trolley. There are only two options that the brain can take: the right side of the fork in the track or the left side of the fork. There is no way in sight of derailing or stopping the trolley and the brain is aware of this, for the brain knows trolleys. The brain is causally hooked up to the trolley such that the brain can determine the course which the trolley will take.

On the right side of the track there is a single railroad worker, Jones, who will definitely be killed if the brain steers the trolley to the right. If the railman on the right lives, he will go on to kill five men for the sake of killing them, but in doing so will inadvertently save the lives of thirty orphans (one of the five men he will kill is planning to destroy a bridge that the orphans' bus will be crossing later that night). One of the orphans that will be killed would have grown up to become a tyrant who would make good utilitarian men do bad things. Another of the orphans would grow up to become G.E.M. Anscombe, while a third would invent the pop-top can.

If the brain in the vat chooses the left side of the track, the trolley will definitely hit and kill a railman on the left side of the track, ""Leftie"" and will hit and destroy ten beating hearts on the track that could (and would) have been transplanted into ten patients in the local hospital that will die without donor hearts. These are the only hearts available, and the brain is aware of this, for the brain knows hearts. If the railman on the left side of the track lives, he too will kill five men, in fact the same five that the railman on the right would kill. However, ""Leftie"" will kill the five as an unintended consequence of saving ten men: he will inadvertently kill the five men rushing the ten hearts to the local hospital for transplantation. A further result of ""Leftie's"" act would be that the busload of orphans will be spared. Among the five men killed by ""Leftie"" are both the man responsible for putting the brain at the controls of the trolley, and the author of this example. If the ten hearts and ""Leftie"" are killed by the trolley, the ten prospective heart-transplant patients will die and their kidneys will be used to save the lives of twenty kidney-transplant patients, one of whom will grow up to cure cancer, and one of whom will grow up to be Hitler. There are other kidneys and dialysis machines available, however the brain does not know kidneys, and this is not a factor.

Assume that the brain's choice, whatever it turns out to be, will serve as an example to other brains-in-vats and so the effects of his decision will be amplified. Also assume that if the brain chooses the right side of the fork, an unjust war free of war crimes will ensue, while if the brain chooses the left fork, a just war fraught with war crimes will result. Furthermore, there is an intermittently active Cartesian demon deceiving the brain in such a manner that the brain is never sure if it is being deceived.

Obama is announced to the podium, and a musical montage set to Hulk Hogan's ""Real American,"" and full of stereotypically American pictures (bald eagles, the long form birth certificate, Michael Jordan, Transformers) plays him in. Obama welcomes everyone and mentions the release of his long form birth certificate. He states that he's also going to go a step further and release his birth video. The video plays, and it's the opening scene from *The Lion King.* Everyone laughs, and Obama makes it clear to the FOX table that the video was a joke, and if they don't believe him, ask Disney because they have the long form. 

Obama talks about how he's too professorial, and comments on how even movie stars (his biggest constituents) are disappointed in him. He singles out Matt Damon, who recently said how he was disappointed in his work. Obama then says, ""Well I just saw *The Adjustment Bureau,* so right back at you."" (paraphrased)

The President then thanks his wife and mentions that they make a great team. Just last week at the White House Easter egg roll, he was passing out bags of candy and she was snatching them back. Obama then makes a quip at NPR and asks, ""You guys are still here?"" He continues to joke about the future of NPR by discussing possible new programming, like ""No Things Considered,"" or ""Wait Wait, Don't Fund Me.""

He continues discussing the deficit and Paul Ryan, who is absent because he is busy working on his budget, which has no room for laughter. However, Michelle Bachman is present, and Obama quips that her presidential aspirations may be in danger because she was born in Canada. He says, ""Yes Michelle, this is how it starts."" He continues by joking about other GOP presidential hopefuls by saying that Tim Pawlenty's real middle name is ""Hosni,"" (after Hosni Mubarak), and that former ambassador Jon Huntsman didn't learn Chinese to go to China, but learned English to come to America.

Obama goes on with the GOP presidential candidate jokes, discussing the, ""vicious rumor,"" that Mitt Romney passed universal healthcare while he was governor of MA, and that Donald Trump should investigate. He really rips into Donald Trump at this point by saying Donald's glad the birth certificate issue is over so he can go back to things that matter, such as, ""Did we fake the moon landing,"" or, ""What really happened at Roswell,"" or, ""Where are Biggie and Tupac?"" 

He also discusses the Donald's experience by talking about a recent episode of *Celebrity Apprentice* where the men's cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks because of a lack of leadership, and fired Gary Busey. These are the kind of decisions that would keep Obama up at night. The President also thinks Trump would bring change to the White House and the camera pans to the screen, showing the White House photoshopped to look like a gaudy casino.

Obama then says it was a wonderful year, especially in film, and praises *The King's Speech.* He claims there is a sequel in the works and plays a trailer about how he cannot give a speech without a teleprompter. The trailer goes on and shows how Joe Biden teaches Obama how to speak without one, albeit with horrific results. The title of this fictitious film is, ""The Presidents' Speech.""

Obama then closes by saluting the men and women overseas, as well as the plight of the people of disaster-stricken Alabama. He tells the audience to keep those Americans in our thoughts and prayers, and that we must help them as much as possible. He says he believes the journalists will do their part in this task as well. He credits the amazing things journalists have done around the world and the danger they are constantly in, praising them for their hard work.

    
TLDR: Obama tells some funny jokes and gets serious at the end. Also, rosebud."

Another thing, a 22yo w/ a full sleeve is just RETARDED.  When you get a lil older youll realize that everything you thought you were at various points in your life have done complete 180s.  You wont think the same way, you wont ACT the same way, you wont be the same person you were 10 yrs from now, but youll still have that same tattoo.  And thatll be fun trying to explain.  People will still see you as the same guy you were when you were 20, but now youre 40.

Imagine it like this.  What if I said I was going to give you ONE outfit to wear for the rest of your life, and you could never change it, but it could be the coolest outfit you could possibly think of.  Now think back.  Would you pick ANY outfit you were wearing 10yrs ago you thought was cool as shit?  You think those designer jeans or that sick shirt are gonna stand the test of time for every situation for the rest of your life?  No way meng.

This accounts for a compute cluster to be disabled, akin to the GTX 480, to keep clock speeds up.

AMD on the other hand is rumored only to be going for a 25% increase in shaders.

Efficiency wise, AMD and Nvidia are a lot closer right now than people credit. Comparing the performance and power of the 7870 and the 680 reveals they're very close. (Like against like, the 7870 and 680 both have gimped double precision FP and run around 1GHz)

With these big chips, I think TDP is going to be the limiting factor. The simple matter is running a big chip at a lower frequency is more efficient than a small chip, fast. AMD is getting in a rut of cranking up the clock speed. It's good for their bottom line, but it's unsustainable.

The only way I see AMD coming out the victor is if they actually had the confidence to make a big GPU. They seemed to have abandoned the 7990, so it's not unreasonable to speculate that they may follow the road Nvidia takes and create massive chips. However, I'm inclined to think this is more wishful thinking on my part."

I was jogging around an outdoor track, enjoying the serenity of a run absent of hills and valleys.  Chen and Karen preferred scenery when we ran, but back in my old life I used to enjoy the mindlessness of a perfectly boring manmade track-and-field course.  Running without thought was as close to meditation as I’ve ever experienced.

We were all in great shape now.  I was on my third mile and feeling no pain.  In the distance I heard the hum of our generator powering the biology lab’s centrifuge and god knows what else.

In my head there was nothing but thoughts of steady breathing, and the pacing of footfalls.  I could feel my heart pumping, my muscles tensing and relaxing, my joints flexing, and the sweat dripping.  For a moment I was not an orphan, a survivor, or a damned soul; I was just machine turning its gears.

It was in this moment of perfect serenity that I heard the voice.  “Hello,” it said.

Startled, I spun my head to see where the voice might have come from.  I lost my footing and tumbled onto the asphalt.  I braced my fall with my forearms, and felt the burn of skinned flesh.  Searing pain exploded from my wrist.

I rolled onto my back, folding my wounded limbs to my chest.  I breathed shallowly through clenched teeth, feeling wave after wave of pain shoot through my body.  I looked around for the source of the voice but there wasn’t a sign of life in any direction for at least a hundred meters.

The pain in my arms and wrist began to subside to a manageable level.  I pondered my next move.  Cleaning the wounds seemed like a good idea.  Although they probably couldn’t become infected, they would become inflamed if any sizable foreign matter wasn’t removed.

As I stood, I realized that my right knee was also quite bloody, and sore when I put weight on it.  I began limping towards the biology lab, then thought the better of it.  If there was any bacteria on this planet that *could* give me an infection, it was probably up there in a lab with my friends.  I changed course and headed for the health services building.

“Hello,” the voice said again.  “We need your help.”

I spun around again, and seeing nothing, brushed my hands to my ears reflexively- though I couldn’t think exactly what I expected that to accomplish.  My pulse was racing now.  Something was wrong.

When I’d heard the voice moments ago on the track, I assumed it was the sort of hallucination one has when they’ve been quite sleep deprived.  It was a brief, transient thing- something to laugh about later.  But *this*?  A complete sentence, just moments later?  This was no small thing.

I tried to enter the health center but found the doors locked.  This was a rare experience at public buildings because of the timing of the… incident.  The health center must have kept bad hours.

I smashed the window with a rock, and reached in to turn the handle.  I made my way to an exam room in the near-dark.  There were no corpses in here- a nice change of pace.

I found some non-stinging disinfecting fluid and some gauze.  I wondered if my cuts could be infected by my own bacteria living on my skin.  I didn’t want to find out.

I bandaged my arms and knee carefully.  The voice said, “We need your help.  You must find us.”

I screamed a stream of nonsense babble in an attempt to drown the voice out.  I stumbled as fast as I could, back to my friends in the lab.  When I was nearly to the door of the science building I heard the voice again “We need your help.  You must find us.”

I was losing my mind.  I limped up the stairs to biology lab, my heart racing with fear and panic.  I threw open the double-doors to the lab.

Karen was perched on the edge of one of the work tables: shirt on, jeans and underwear crumpled on the floor beneath her.  Chen was between her legs, similarly attired.  His back was to me, and he was thrusting into her wildly.

Karen’s bare legs were wrapped around him, and her hands clawed at his back.  Their grunts and moans filled the room over the sound of a spinning centrifuge.   I stood for a moment in stunned silence. 

Karen’s eyes were squeezed tightly closed in an ecstatic spasm.  I stumbled backwards out of the room, but one half of the double-door had already closed.  In my haste to leave I slammed into it with my face.  It made a terrible banging sound, and I squeezed my eyes shut in pain.  I tumbled backward into the hallway and landed against the far wall, sliding down to the floor and gripping my wounded face, with my wounded hand.

Before I had time to pity myself, I heard the voice again, “We need your help.  You must find us.”

I stood and ran awkwardly down the hallway to the stairwell.  I half ran- half fell down the stairs, and kept going until was outside in the open, stale air.  I fell to my knees on what used to be a grassy lawn.  I started heaving violently, unsure if I was vomiting or sobbing.  Blood streamed down my face from the gash I’d just given myself.

“We need your help.  You must find us.”

I threw my hands over my ears and curled up into a ball on the earth.  I shut my eyes and started rocking myself to distract from the pain in my body, and the panic in my mind.

I didn’t notice when Karen flew outside through the doors and ran over to me.  I was startled moment’s later when I felt her hand on my shoulder.  I looked up at her, and saw the pity in her eyes.  She thought I was having a fit out of jealousy.

When she saw the blood on my face and the terror in my eyes, her expression changed.  She screamed for Chen.  When I saw my fear reflected in her, it was too much.  I wasn’t sobbing exactly, but my throat was tight and I was breathing in harsh, raspy breaths.

When Karen asked me what was wrong, I was unable to speak.  As I tried to calm myself and form the words, I heard it again. 

“We need your help. You must find us. There isn’t much time.”

Irrespective has a similar meaning and similar sound to regardless, and the blending occurs when a speaker mistakenly applies the prefix from one to the other. It's a common error for the uneducated/inarticulate. They then go on to use irregardless to mean the same thing as irrespective or regardless, which is **an error**. This is why they state: 

**""Its reputation has not risen over the years, and it is still a long way from general acceptance. Use regardless instead.""**

That seems pretty unequivocal to me.

In the definition of ""irregardless"" the word ""non-standard"" is to point out the word type, much the same as slang is used for ""douche bag""."

There is, and a very good one, even using conventional economics: if you can borrow at 2% and lend or generate 4% returns, then you should do so indefinitely, and there is no sane reason to ever pay down debt or stop taking on more of it. 

So-called ""neo-chartalists"" would take this a step further, and basically recommend that Barack Obama resolve the debt by ordering the treasury to mint a $15tn platinum coin, and deposit it in the treasury, or some such. Viola, zero debt. This is both legally and technically possible, and would, in fact and practice, bring the treasury balance back to zero. And it's not just nutjobs arguing for it. See here for more on other ""heterodox economics"", including the Austrian school, and the not-too outlandish ideas of so-called ""Market Monetary Theory"", which holds that central bankers should not distinguish between real growth and inflationary growth:

http://www.economist.com/node/21542174 

If your only econ education comes via internet forums, you might think that there are two ""schools"" of economics, ""Austrian"" and ""Keynesian"". In truth, ""Keynesian"" is not really a ""school"", it's what fringe economists accuse mainstream economists of being. 

John Maynard Keynes contributed a lot of ideas to econ, but the big one that sticks in the craw of so-called ""Austrian"" or ""classical"" economists is the notion that government deficit-spending can boost economic activity. This is absolutely, 100%, uncontested mainstream economics-- no fortune 1,000 company would ever hire a senior economist who did not believe that government spending could impact economic growth. There is no ""school of thought"" dispute on this point: right or wrong, what Austrians call ""Keynesian"" is mainstream, and everything else is fringe or heterodox. Economists do not call themselves ""keynesian economists"" any more than physicists call themselves ""Eisenstein"" physicists. That's something you get accused of being, by people who want to imply a sense of parity with non-mainstream ideas. 

If you only know econ from internet debates, you might think that ""Keynesian"" is some kind of liberal theory of social justice or something, but it's not. It's a baked-in-the-cake component of mainstream economics that says that governments have the ability to stimulate economic growth through spending. 

Without taking a position on the rightness or wrongness, it is fair to say that ""keynsian"" is mainstream econ, and those who reject it run the gamut from heterodox to ""fringe"". 

Back to the point...

- From a mainstream, ""Keynesian"" POV, there is no reason to ever pay off debt, the only consideration is to keep GDP growth higher than debt growth and inflation, long-term, so that the payments are sustainable. 

- From a MMT POV (which is still fringe, but which follows orthodox econ), it's not even necessary to worry about inflation, all that matters is to grow the nominal GDP, and the rest will follow. 

- From a neo-chartalist POV, all this worry about debts and deficits is much ado about nothing. Money is a pure abstraction, representing the good faith and credit of the USA, and if it ever becomes a problem, you can just mint trillion-dollar platinum (or copper) coins, whatever. 

- The Austrian POV (bracing for downvotes) is something like a ""real value"" notion of money, wherein gov't debt or monetary policy can only, at best, fuel bubbles based on too-easy credit or investment capital. A pure ""Austrian"" or ""classical"" economist essentially rejects monetary policy and regards all econ as a system of individual barter transactions or value-exchanges. From the ""austrian"" POV, there is little or nothing that fiscal or monetary policy can do except impede or distort the real economy. It is often tied up with libertarian ideologies, but they are separate things. 

Of the above, it is perhaps only the ""Austrian"" school that would argue against deficit-spending into a recession, and then only the most die-hard followers who would actually argue that deficit-reduction would lead to faster economic growth.

I'm disappointed that we didn't get a proper answer about the overbalancing of bosses, but hopefully the update on that topic will confirm some type of fix, cause right now they have completely missed the mark.

The main thing though is that their logic and reasoning behind all the changes they made make sense to me, even if the end result wasn't implemented as smoothly as possible. This gives me hope because it does seem like they actually know what they are doing, which I was really starting to question. They just need to tune the changes they are making in game better.

1) They gave solid reasoning for their opinions and admitted they may have overtuned the bosses / champion ratios, which I'm hoping will result in bosses being toned back once again because how it was before seemed perfect with the new drop rates (as long as they buff 60+ item drops..).

This is probably one of my biggest areas of contention with them though. Why the hell do they have this image in their head of what will make the game the most fun? Did they ever stop to ask the players what they wanted? Personally before this patch I was killing 8 elites + 2 bosses in a great fast run which had a lot of variety and felt FUN. After the patch it is now impossible to do Cydea as a ranged, and i'm reduced to warping around the map being bored searching for random champions. I really don't see how their vision is good for the game. If people want to do runs then they should be allowed to play as they want. They really don't have a clue what made Diablo 2 farming fun in my opinion, which is a major stumbling block in their design along with the itemization in general.

2) I think NV works perfectly as it is right now, and doesn't need changed. I agree with their reasoning here and really hope they don't cave in to community pressure concerning more important issues which this seems to be riding on the back of.

3) I don't agree that the IAS nerf was a big deal. I do think it could have been handled slightly better / not nerfed as harshly though. At the end of the day moving and attacking fast is a major fun factor in the game, and removing that seems like a bad move overall. They should have perhaps buffed base attack speed on all classes, but lowered damage so that base DPS remained the same. Then they could have cut the **itemization** of AS by 50% like they have now, but still kept the fun factor of attacking quickly. It's probably not as simple as that due to how things scale etc, but off the top of my head some workaround like that would have been better.

Most people complaining about this seem to be piggybacking off the issue of spending a lot of gold to buy IAS items and them now being worthless. Which is annoying I agree, I personally was in the same boat but I realize that IAS was severely over budgeted and had to be changed.. you just have to grin and bear it sometimes.

I don't buy the issue of people buying IAS items on the RMAH and those items now being worthless though. The devs had already stated that would  be nerfing IAS before the RMAH was up, investing money into items at that time is just your own stupidity.


4) This is just tuning. It's expected. I do think they should have hotfixed WD's though.

5) I'm happy they are going to be adding items back to breakables. It was always a nice suprise to find something nice in a pot. However people are blowing this issue way out of proportion imo, breaking pots isn't good gameplay, it's a minor part of the game which is 'nice' to have, having it being an option for getting the majority of your loot just encourages botters and is generally bad for gameplay.

6) Stats could definitely do with a rework.

7) Can't really comment on this, I wasn't really affected  by the issue.

8) The repair changes were ~~RIDICULOUS, and need to be reverted asap~~ perhaps over-balanced. I laughed at people saying Blizzard were forcing you to use the AH before this change, but now it is undeniable. There is simply no way to get enough gold to cover repair costs during normal play. We should not be forced to sell items on the AH in order to repair. I'm tired of going on about this issue, but it was a terrible decision and removes a lot of freedom and fun from the game.

**edit**: I admit I probably over exaggerated on this point due to the frustration I was having with Cydea, and lumped the repairs from that into the argument in my head. It isn't as drastic as I first felt, however I still think it needs tweaking so that it discourages death without being prohibitive to gameplay other than farming, removing the general wear and tear could bring it back into balance so i'll wait and see.  

I'd like to thank everyone for their interesting and thought out replies though, I can be a bit ragey at times and it's refreshing to have an actual discussion the way things have been lately.

9) - 

10) Already mentioned this before, disappointed that they didn't provide a response, this is a huge issue and i'm looking forward to reading the response. Hopefully they don't ""forget"" about this question.

Overall i'm still unhappy after 1.03, and will be taking a break untill the drop rates are buffed again. I will still enjoy the game i'm sure, but like most people I have the nagging feeling that this game should have been so much more. This gives me hope that after a lot of changes (or perhaps an expansion) the game will be fit to rival D2 though."

1300,22983,,,,,687.0,"When I graduated high school I went to college and got my certificate to be an EMT. I did this so I would have a job to help pay for school while I studied to be a nurse. The first call I ever got (to go out into the field on an ambulance) will haunt me for the rest of my life. A 4 year old girl with severe cerebral palsy rolled over in her sleep and was unable to roll back. She suffocated. We got the call and loaded ourselves up to go. When we got there the most heartbreaking scene unfolded before me. The grandfather was sitting in his wheelchair, tears slowly falling. He just stared straight ahead the entire time we were there. The mother kept running back to the little girl's room (the little girl was laying on the floor in the living room so we could have room to work) and she would grab a stuffed animal and run back into the living room. She kept saying this like ""Baby, you have to wake up for Bun-Bun! Wake up Baby! Do you want Froggybottom? I'll get him for you! Wake up Baby! Please wake up!"" I can still remember every name of every stuffed creature she brought to her baby. The thing is, her baby had died during the night and had been dead for hours. Most people don't know that CPR has about a 5% chance of actually helping you. If have been dead for any significant length of time, you might as well not even try. I know it sounds horrible but the fact is it simply won't do anything at that point. Doesn't mean we didn't try. Doesn't mean we don't always try. You never know who will be in the 5%, so you have to try. The family needed us to try. So for 45 long minutes, we tried. We tried everything we could try. Towards the end, the mother disappeared into the little girl's bedroom and didn't come back. We finally pronounced and we're making arrangements for the coroner to come when I decided for some stupid reason to go get the mother. I shouldn't have done that. She was tearing apart the girl's room frantically searching for something. ""Ma'am, we need you to come into the living room."" ""I just have to find her Kitty. It's named Snugglebutt and I just know that's what she is waiting for! Help me! "" ""ma'am, I'm so sorry, but we need you to come into the living room...."" I had no idea what to say. Should I tell her we pronounced? Do I tell her the coroner will have some questions for you? I was young and inexperienced and had no clue what my next words should be. So I said nothing. I moved into the room and began searching with her. About 5-10 minutes later the ambulance crew I was training with came into the room. They kindly explained everything to her. The stupid thing is, the entire time they talked to her and comforted her, I kept searching for that damn stuffed cat. I guess I felt that since I couldn't help her in any other capacity I might as well find this stuffed animal for her. I found it in the back of the girl's closet under a pile of clothes. The mother was an absolute wreck and eventually we sedated her after a consult with our Medical Director. The entire ride there was in absolute silence save for the light sobs by the mother. We dropped her off at the ER and explained everything to the staff. We cleaned out our ride, refilled supplies we had used and headed out to another call. To this day I still get up 4 times a night to check to make sure everyone in the house is breathing. My husband, daughter and even the pets get checked every single night. I have trouble letting our little girl spend the night with anyone but us because I can't check on her if she isn't home. I went on to get my first degree in Emergency Medicine and became a Paramedic, then continued my education to get a degree as an RN. I have worked I the medical field for years and have seen a lot of life and death in my time, but I cannot forget the ones who were beyond our help. I know it's not healthy but I can't let them go. Don't get me wrong, I have made peace with death and what comes with it. I know I am not to blame for these people's passing, but the thought of letting go of them entirely is simply something I cannot do. Every new patient I get reminds me that we can be here one minute and gone the next. I wonder every now and again what happened to that family. I hope they are doing well and are at peace. 

TL;DR: first call as a newbie EMT was a dead four year old whose mother do not take it well. It's fucked me up. "

Yolanda James? How do you feel about someone who is compelled to bring $100,000 per year in electoral contribution to the electoral coffers of her party so she won't be booted out? At least, did she lose a bit of her luster once you learned that?

&gt; I may still vote CAQ - Legault is a bonafide businessman (he developed Air Transat).

Businessmen are totally incompetent to run governments, because governments are not business.

But what makes François Legault even more unqualified was his use of unions at Air-Transat to go through though times, and then when business picked-up, quietly selling his actions without telling his partners.

So, that would make a terrific leader, someone who stealthily bails out from his partners by leaving by the back door…"

I have a friend who is always successful in job interviews. One day we're talking about interviews and resumes and whatnot, and I ask him what his secret to success is.

The key, he says, is the ""where do you see yourself in 10 years"" question. When posed this question, he will take a minute, flash a pensive look towards the sky, then lock eyes with the interviewer. ""Space.""

I ask, Space? What the fuck, don't you work in finance?

As he extrapolates on this answer, I realize how perfect this response really is. It gives him a chance to talk about human advancement, and how the world we live in is becoming crazier and more amazing every day. It allows him to boast about his desire for worldliness, and doing things that push the envelope.

Soon after, we found out that one of the types actually had caffeine. All of the kids freaked out, thinking they were going to get in trouble.

Nah, I'm just giving an example of how we can shut down the conversation for no real reason.

&gt;I told you one thing: that if you are living a promiscuous lifestyle you should inform your partners.

And I generally disagree, largely because of how impractical it would be in a given situation. Many of my ""partners"" aren't my girlfriends -- for many of them, we've only known each other for an hour or two. And neither of us goes into any detail about our sexual history, and we definitely don't start detailing our sexual ""profile,"" or anything like that. It just wouldn't make much sense in the situation. And I'm saying that if you're even *dealing* with situations like that in the first place, then you're already possibly passing on STDs without the other person knowing about it. 

And that's bad, but again, for the most part, it can't be avoided. Even if you find out that you're ""clean,"" you could still have something. Even if you find out that you have something, it still might not matter at all. Is it good to get checked every so often, just for the hell of it? Yeah. Should you tell the girl about it? Sure, if the situation allows for it. "

When animators, such as myself, go to school we watch all sorts of animation, from ones that are crude, black and white or drawn using other methods (South Park, Archer), it expands our creative thinking process of what can be done artistically. 

Artists will use visual art styles to help them convey a story. The next time you watch an animation ask yourself, would the message and feel of this animation have been different if they used a different technique? For example how would Nightmare Before Christmas feel if it was in the same animation style as Big Hero 6? In vice versa how would Big Hero 6 feel in Nightmare Before Christmas' artstyle and animation style? 

What Big Hero 6 did, was it essentially combined Pixar's traditional ""realistic play-doh"" art style with the art styles of anime and (where this type of story arc is mostly from) and spent ENORMOUS time on the aesthetic realism in the backgrounds. 

This all comes together heavily at the climax. I don't want to spoil it, but there is a VERY VERY complex set at the end that utilizes the little details and visually stimating scenes they create. 

About the blur effects: animating REALLY REALLY obvious things are super easy. What I've noticed Disney does REMARKABLY is animate mannerisms in a character. If you watch, they move with slight deliberation when they shrug, roll their eyes, or fidget. This is HUGE and REDICULIUSLY difficult to pull off. The same thing goes for perceiving extremely quick movement. The blurs are so subtle your brain automatically is like ""that's just like in real life!"" But as an animator, creating those blurs so they don't punch you in the face is really tedious and to many (myself included) not worth it. In Big Hero 6 they pulled this off, multiple times. 

These effects can be studied by new generation animators to help us leap to the next level and tackle even BIGGER difficulties within the animation world. 

Edit: the biggest thing for me, is that Big Hero 6 animated a seemingly emotionless robot which no visual ques or color and turned him into an ADORABLE character FULL of emotion, just by how he walks and holds his posture. "

I guess the fact that people are basically the same everywhere. That people have rights. If you talked about human rights to anyone back then (not that I would ever have conceived of it), you might as well have been speaking in a foreign language. Today even the youngest of kids know their rights.

I didn't know that black people were actually people. They weren't animals either; they were just part of the landscape. They spoke a funny language (Xhosa where I grew up), and they were mostly seen digging ditches, tending white people's gardens and generally doing menial stuff. It never occurred to me that a black person could be a professor, for example.

I didn't know that I was living in an abnormal society or that apartheid was wrong. When I first started hearing political mumblings about these things during my teenage years, I simply couldn't wrap my head around it. Imagine an uneducated hillbilly from Mississippi watching Jon Stewart on the Daily Show. It was something like that.

Today I have a lot of my old friends from back home on facebook (I live abroad now), and almost all their status updates are about how great God is and about the power of prayer. We grew up with something called a Christian National Education. From where I'm standing now, South Africa and most South Africans are puerile and extremely watered down intellectually. My mother, and most coloured people from my home town can sit and watch Oprah, Doctor Phil, clairvoyant people who contact the dead and The Bold and the Beautiful all day long, and when discussing any sort of personal problem they'd quote Dr Phil or Oprah as the highest authorities.

It's a douchebag thing to say, because I care a lot about these people, and when I'm with my old friends I fall back into that old persona that they still embrace and expect me to be. Part of me still loves it, but I get impatient and really wish that people can get a move on and start thinking clearly about their circumstances and old ideas.

 I was on the other end of this once.

 One summer after college I moved from the dorm back home to my parent's house. All of my college stuff (bedding, winter clothing, school supplies, and desktop computer) went into storage in the basement of my Dad's office. It's a huge storage space where we stored the family's jet skis, my dad's antique Mustang, and all sort of other stuff. No big deal.

 Well, the basement flooded that summer. My dad swore that the water damage wasn't that bad and my stuff didn't get wet. I trusted him so I never checked on my belongings.

 Come August I pull out all of my stuff. I open my bin of winter clothes and the smell hits me - MOLD. EVERYWHERE. Dear God, the water did get into my belongings and it festered for 8 long weeks in the dark, warm basement. 

 My winter clothes were ruined as well as my nostrils. I bought new clothes and carried on my merry way back to college to start my sophomore year. I tried plugging my computer in at my dorm but it wouldn't start. Hmm...so I took it to a repair shop. 


A few days later the repair man calls me and says ""Um, ma'am, you need to come in...."" I go in. They show me the inside of my desktop. Not only was it all rusted, there was MOLD. Mold in a freaking computer, I shit you not. 

 I tried to explain the flood but the guys obviously thought I was a stupid college kid (which I was). So please forgive us for our gross computers. 


TL;DR - Mold grew in my desktop."

1425,19747,,,,,117,"Google Inc. is a  multinational public cloud computing, Internet search, and advertising technologies corporation. Google hosts and develops a number of Internet-based services and products, and generates profit primarily from advertising through its AdWords program.

When a client computer attempts to connect to Google, several DNS servers resolve www.google.com into multiple IP addresses via Round Robin policy. Furthermore, this acts as the first level of load balancing and directs the client to different Google clusters. A Google cluster has thousands of servers and once the client has connected to the server additional load balancing is done to send the queries to the least loaded web server. This makes Google one of the largest and most complex content delivery networks.

  Google requires large computational resources in order to provide their services. Racks are custom-made and contain 40 to 80 servers (20 to 40 1U servers on either side), while new servers are 2U Rackmount systems. Each rack has a switch. Servers are connected via a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet link to the local switch. Switches are connected to core gigabit switch using one or two gigabit uplinks.

  Since queries are composed of words, an inverted index of documents is required. Such an index allows obtaining a list of documents by a query word. The index is very large due to the number of documents stored in the servers. The index is partitioned by document IDs into many pieces called shards. Each shard is replicated onto multiple servers. Initially, the index was being served from disks, like it's done in traditional IR systems. Then in early 2001 Google switched to an in-memory index system, as they had found that they had enough replicas to keep a copy of the whole index in main memory (each shard is partitioned over memory of all its replicas). This switch had ""radically changed many design parameters"" of their search system, and allowed them to enjoy a big increase in throughput and a big decrease in latency of queries."

You asked how do they know to change gears but I may as well explain the whole thing. PLEASE NOTE THIS CUTS ALOT OF CORNERS TO SIMPLIFY IT.


There are many different systems, but there are 3 main systems (exculding CVT's), hydraulic operated automatics (relatively old school, although still used), computer controlled (allot smoother and more responsive) and Semi Automatic Manuals. 


I will initally talk about hydraulic operated automatics as they are purely mechanical and are probably the most interesting. Natrually in a gearbox you want a reduction in engine shaft speed to or near ground speed (depending on diff ratio). Before I go any further a gearbox is there to multiply torque through changing shaft speeds, it does not multiply power (you can never multiply power). People need to realise that Torque is the abilty to do work and Power is the rate at which I can do it. 


But anyway this is done in an automatic through a plantery gear set (http://appauto.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/planetarygearset.jpg). This consists of a Sun gear, Plantery gear and a Ring gear, and has a few really cool tricks. With a normal gear set we supply power to one gear that turns another thus gearing it up or down depending on the ratio, with a plantery set we have 3 places to introduce shaft speed and we can remove it from the either of the two remianing gears, and we can stop or allow the other remainding gear to rotate. For example 


    Input           Output           Held Gear               Gearing
    Sun             Planet            Ring                       Up
    Planet         Ring               Sun                        Down
    Sun             Ring              Planet                     Reverse


But this only what is called a 2 speed, more 'speeds' are added by using more gear sets either in series or parrellel, they also allow for alot of really cool tricks, most of which are probably outside of this basic explaination, but if you are interested this video gives a good basic understanding (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQhzruw2Qh8&amp;feature=related).


But how do we select which gear is the input and output and which gear is locked? By the use of Bands and Clutches. A Band is literally what it sounds like, its a band that wraps around the Ring gear holding it in place, locking it to the gear box case. The clutch (usual a basket clutch like a motorcycle) perform several functions like locking the sun gear to the input shaft. So by actuating the bands and clutches at different times and what not we can acheive different gear ratios.
.

But now you are probably thinking right so there is a planetry gearbox that is all magical and just magically decides when to change gear. Well this is the cool bit and why I love pure hyrdraulic automatics. Now remember those Bands and Clutches you are probably going but wtf actuates these? Hydraulics, awesomely designed Hydraulics, most people are aware of electronic logic gates, the same exists in hydraulics. I will keep this as simple as possible, as most people get lost here (if I havent already lost you). 


**Answer to Orignal Question** 
On the input shaft of the automatic gear box is a hydraulic pump that produces pressure, on the output shaft (usually) there is a centrifugal governor, basically the faster it spins the more pressure it allows into the hydraulic circuit. In real layman terms this is what selects each gear. But realality is far more awesome, remember how pressure is related to speed? well it is also related to strain on the gearbox, this is how in some cases it knows how to change down (not all gearboxes use this but). This Pressure is then sent into a hydraulic circuit that uses what I will call logic gates, depending on flow rate and pressure and the current engaded circuit it opens pressure into a piston that then forces onto a belt or a band or some combination, hence selecting the right gear. Here is an example of a cirucit (http://www.seekic.com/uploadfile/ic-circuit/2011912639162.gif), seem simple right? Yeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh. They are even funner in real life (http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/automatic-transmission-brain.jpg)


Now Remeber how I said this is the old school type of auto? Neither of the photos I just gave was of a Old school auto (I think) they dont really seem right, but this is only an explaination so they are good enough for a reference, I cant find any ""good"" old photos.  Now this why I am not a real fan of modern automatics. They use the ECU and usually take input such as brake pressure, engine rpm, gearbox speed, throttle position (and even rate of application) and even things like steer angle in some, then operate electric actuatuated that allow pressure onto pistons that acutuate the bands or clutches etc etc. Smoother, more effiecent, yes, but the awesome hydraulic circuits are sadly gone.


Now probably thinking sweet this sounds good (or your head has exploded), but what is this Torque converter I hear so much about? Up until this stage I have not mentioned anything about how we engade or disengade drive at idle. Right, imagine a boat propeller, it spinning moves the boat forward? Yes, now imagine if we held the boat stationary, it would move the water. right? now magine if we put a second propeller in that water and held what ever it was attachted to stationary, the propeller would spin. This is this the basis of the torque converter, although with less boating action (sadly). 
A really good video (again from the 1950s and the US army) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8EHTTNPEg). But this is the cool part, a torque converter as you probably imagine from the name, multiples torque, but it varies with the relative speed of the two impellers (its what the earlier propellers are actually callgger difference bigger torque. Torque converters also cause the slop you usually notice in auto's as fluid is being acted on a impeller and then acting on another, this all has mass (hence inerita) and takes time to act.etc etc


More sportier and in my experience most modern cars then use a clutch in the middle of the torque converter, this allows the torque converter to do its thing  like allow the engine to idle and multiply torque off the line, but then at high rpms it locks the torque converter together (and thus negating it) meaning better throttle repsonse and better fuel economy (no losses in the torque converter). Random side note this is usual given as the reason for why Americans used to drive big v8's and alike, torque converters were intially very inefficient and very heavy requiring big engines to move then around.


And finally Semi-Automatics especially in really expensive cars, are just normal manuals that are just controlled by the ECU. Efficient? yes. Quick to change? Hell yes. As big of a mind fuck? Not really.


**TLDR (everyone):Hydraulic pump makes pressure depending on speed, this then acutates a piston that selects a gear. Some unicorn blood may or may not be involved. Watch the videos linked above**
Also if you have any other questions, I really dont mind answering them.


And no I do not work for a gearbox company, actually I am yet to graduate from uni (although I am looking for work, hint hint)"

Look for a massive push by Hillary Clinton's camp to ""reseat"" delegates from Michigan and Florida, which were taken away by the DNC previously.  

Florida is probably similar, but I'm in Michigan, and I can tell what I feel is happening here.

Michigan is home to Detroit, which has about 900k people, 700k-ish of which are African American, in a state of about 10M people.

Some months ago, it was clear that Obama was Clinton's #1 competitor. If he was even marginally successful, Detroit's vote, along with other cities with large/majority African American populations, such as Flint or Grand Rapids, would give Obama an easy victory in Michigan, and despite our losses, we're still a top 10 state.

So, our Governor Jennifer Granholm, who endorses Hillary Clinton, agreed to hold an early primary (Jan 15, 2008), probably knowing that Hillary Clinton's friends within the DNC would then cut our votes out of the Democratic Nomination, eliminating this advantage for Obama and giving Clinton the edge she needs. Michigan Republicans, seeing a chance to make the Democrats look bad by ignoring Michigan voters, agreed, and the changes sailed through.

And that's exactly what happened.

Clinton broke her pledge not to campaign here, stayed on the ballot when all of the other democrats pulled out, and won a pointless victory.

Now there is talk that our Governor Granholm is joining the Clinton administration, for all of her ""help"" in ""winning"" Michigan.

""help"" in suppressing the black vote.

And we can expect Clinton to push hard to make those delegate votes count again.  Delegates selected without the favored candidate of the likely majority of Democratic voters.

It's just another way to ""keep the black man down""

How sad.

The sentece ""Germans were never ""manipulated""."" is just plain wrong. No country or men is plain evil and does things just for the cause of it.

Decided I had had enough of depending on other people to keep my job, a friend of mine and I opened up our own shop.  Had a logo, motto, mission statement, the whole ball of wax.  Pretty proud of it.  Even though I've since moved on, I kept all the swag like cup holders we made.

One of my best clients early on was a man of Lebanese decent who spoke very little English.  He usually dropped his computer stuff off at my place to have it fixed and then would pick it up the next day.  He had 3 kids and a wife and no matter how much I taught him how to avoid getting viruses he'd keep getting them.  He was very kind and often brought me some of his wifes cooking so I started just doing work for free since he didn't have much money and they were typically quick fixes.

About two months in I get a call from him and he needs me to come over and remove parental controls he had accidentally put on his computer.  He needed me to come as his car was low on gas, he didn't have money to get gas until Friday so he needed to conserve.

I go over and during the course of removing the offending software, his daughter comes and sits next to me.  We had talked about her only briefly and he said that she was studying to be a nurse.  She was absolutely smoking hot, wearing a pretty revealing tank top, short skirt.

She looks early 20's, mabye 22. One thing about me.  I look young.  Very young.  When I shave I look like I'm 20 and I'm 31 now, was 28 at the time.

She asks me about myself, my business, what I'm interested in, stuff of that nature.  I spend more time talking to her then paying attention to the laptop.  There's some pretty obvious chemistry between us.  Eventually she asks me if I have a girlfriend.  I said no, I don't.  She said do I want one.  I said if the right girl comes along.  She smiled and scooted closer to me.

After a couple minutes of sitting there trying my best not to pop a tent I realize that I'm not going to be able to get the computer fixed on the spot.  I'll need a boot CD to remove the software and had left it at home.  I explain it to her, she goes and explains it to her dad.  He nods and asks if I can return it the next day after 4 PM.  I agree.

I spend that night furiously purging myself.

The next day comes and I head on over, repaired laptop in tow.  I knock on the door and the girl answers, impossibly wearing even less then the day before.  She lets me in and I put the laptop back and start to boot it up.  It's then that I notice a book bag on the floor with a bunch of obviously high school text books.  I look at the girl, then back to the bag of books and ask her what grade she's in.

Sophomore.  In High School.  She's 16.  This smoking hot slightly ethnic girl who wants to jump me is 16.  My mind is screaming to get the fuck out of there.  I thank her, decline payment for the repair and leave.
 
Two days later I get another call.  The laptop won't go online. I head over and that's when the girls mother finally introduces herself to me.  She says, ""Ah, this is the man my Carmila goes on about!  You are a fine looking young man indeed!  She is quite stricken by you!""

I smile, thank her for the compliment.  Fixing the laptop only takes me a minute. It's a simple wireless kill switch issue on the laptop.  While confirming that it works now, I notice the girl peeking at me from her bedroom.  She looks at me and licks her lips and makes a 'come hither' gesture with her finger then smiles and closes the door.

I sigh and leave wondering why she couldn't be 18.

A few nights later the girl calls me at round 9 pm. She says the laptop broke again and she needs me to fix it right away for school work.  I summon my best professional integrity and show up.

I take a look at the laptop.  Someone had managed to jam a SD card into the slot the wrong way.

Now, I don't know if any of you know this, but that's pretty hard to do even with a hammer.  She spends a great deal of time showing off her cleavage to me, brushing up against me, touching me.  Her mother is in bed and her dad is at work. I tell her I'm not comfortable with this.  That I think she's very pretty, I admire her ambition but I'm too old for her.

She smiles and nods and sits down nearby and behaves herself.  I fix the laptop and leave.

Two nights later I'm getting milk from Wal-Mart.  It's about 11 PM.  When I get out near my car I notice someone next to my car unable to start it.  She's a fairly old lady and I offer to help her jump her car.  She thanks me profusely.  As we finally get the engine started who should run up to the car?

It's the girl.  I just jump started her grandmothers car.  She hugs me, a little too tightly. She grabs something she shouldn't.  Not wanting to embarrass her in front of her grandmother I disengage, smile and leave.

A few nights later I get a call from her father, Ricky.  He wants to thank me for helping out his mother and for all the free help I've been giving and insists I come over for a home cooked meal.  I decline but he insists.  I really like the guy so I eventually cave and show up.

I show up and breathe a sigh of relief as his daughter is nowhere to be found.  We sit down to eat and after a few minutes the mother shouts that she can come out now.  She's wearing an absolutely gorgeous dress, her hair is done, she was just...man.  I can't even tell you.  It hurts to think about it.  You want to talk jailbait?  I've never felt so uncomfortable in my life.

It's then that her dad asks me if I want to sleep with his daughter.

I nearly choke.

Her mother laughs.  She smiles and says that they really like me and think I would be a good fit for their daughter and want me to date her.  The girl sits next to me and starts rubbing my thigh.  Her mother says that she wants her daughter to lose her virginity.

To me.

My mind can't handle it.  I excuse myself and leave.  The next day her father shows up on my door, upset that I refused but understands why I would hesitate.  Apparently he had spoken with a coworker who had explained the laws of the US to him.  He said that he would not 'get the law involved.  You may have my daughter.'

Anyways...

2 years later the girl got in contact with me again.  She was now legal and wanted me to be with her.  I was engaged to my now wife at the time.  She cried, saying that she had 'stayed pure for me by her fathers will.'

It's been a little over a year now and occasionally I'll get a friend request from her on facebook or a text message asking if I'm still married.

Edit: Because of a lot of people asking, age of consent here is 18.  There are no excuse laws either like you didn't know, you're 19 or the parents consented."

You have very self important people repeating the same mantra over and over again against a totally ridiculous straw-man for doing the same. Most of us on reddit who are not /r/atheism zealots have the maturity to live and let live and ignore stupid people and let arguments stand for themselves.  Besides, the arguments commonly put forth by /r/atheism to justify their zealotry are disingenuous; people don't join this movement due to some altruistic desire to 'free the world from mind controlling religion'; they join because they want to argue against the straw man, piss on dumb people, and have their ideology confirmed. the justification is just superstructure. But, more than any other reason /r/atheism is ripe for parody, they have no sense of humor about atheism, religion, or related topics, at all. (try going to /r/atheism and say something remotely blasphemous about the god delusion. You'll get downvoted faster than you would criticizing Obama on /r/politics last November or Ron Paul on /r/ronpaul.) Also, its funny when /r/atheism acts like a religion, which is all the time.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, the many non-theists of reddit who avoid /r/athiesm often do so because they are comfortable with not knowing things and are actually annoyed when people claim to know the answer to unknowable metaphysical claims.  /r/athiesm is a cicle jerk amongst people who cannot accept not knowing the answer and being right about every single question and must go somewhere where everyone else has the same need to be right and agrees on the answer. Nobody knows, not you, not the Christians, I know it hurts your ego, but somebody has to tell you. I am only doing this as part of an altruistic movement to free the world from know-it-allism...can't you see how believers (in their own ego) are worshiping a false god (themselves) and are brainwashed (by their own ego)????? Again, I am being altruistic, this has nothing to do with me being annoyed by /r/athiesm and wanting to bash on a straw man."

&gt;Right now, American manufacturing is struggling to fill 200,000 vacant positions. **There are 450,000 openings in trades, transportation and utilities. The skills gap is real, and it’s getting wider. In Alabama, a third of all skilled tradesmen are over 55. They’re retiring fast, and no one is there to replace them.**

&gt;Alabama’s not alone. A few months ago in Atlanta I ran into Tom Vilsack, our Secretary of Agriculture. Tom told me about a governor who was unable to move forward on the construction of a power plant. The reason was telling. It wasn’t a lack of funds. It wasn’t a lack of support. It was a lack of qualified welders.

&gt;In general, we’re surprised that high unemployment can exist at the same time as a skilled labor shortage. We shouldn’t be. We’ve pretty much guaranteed it.

&gt;In high schools, the vocational arts have all but vanished. We’ve elevated the importance of “higher education” to such a lofty perch that all other forms of knowledge are now labeled “alternative.” Millions of parents and kids see apprenticeships and on-the-job-training opportunities as “vocational consolation prizes,” best suited for those not cut out for a four-year degree. And still, we talk about millions of “shovel ready” jobs for a society that doesn’t encourage people to pick up a shovel.

&gt;In a hundred different ways, we have slowly marginalized an entire category of critical professions, reshaping our expectations of a “good job” into something that no longer looks like work. A few years from now, an hour with a good plumber â€“ if you can find one â€“ is going to cost more than an hour with a good psychiatrist. At which point we’ll all be in need of both.

&gt;I came here today because guys like my grandfather are no less important to civilized life than they were 50 years ago. Maybe they’re in short supply because we don’t acknowledge them they way we used to. We leave our check on the kitchen counter, and hope the work gets done. That needs to change.



What people don't seem to understand is:

1&gt; College is overrated, not worthless and people should stop confusing the two terms. Arguing that college isn't worthless fails to make an argument about cost and benefit.

2&gt; You can't make everyone go to school. If at 18 someone doesn't want to do well at college, they won't. This idea that everyone can benefit from ""expanding their horizons"" is bullshit. You can lead a horse to water...
And if that horse won't drink, then you should find something useful, prideful, and self-supporting for them to do."

I'm not voting your post up or down because I don't know anything about your situation.  Some questions that should factor into this decision:

1. Has your father previously demonstrated homophobia?  How much?  (Inappropriate jokes?  Statements that homosexual activity is sinful?  Violent comments against gay marriage?)
2.  Are you a legal minor?  Is he your legal guardian?  (If yes to both, he might be able to force you into ""treatment"".)
3.  Whether or not you are a minor, do you rely on your father for housing, food, tuition, or financial support of any kind?  Would you be able to get by if he cut any or all of that off?

If he does have legal or financial control over you right now, and he has expressed extreme or violent anti-gay sentiments, this might not be a good time.  Wait until you're legally and financially independent.  If he shows tolerance around gay rights issues, etc. and you have a strong, open relationship in other regards, it might work.  Unless he already has figured it out (and even if he has) it still will probably be difficult for him to hear this news and work through it.  I recommend that whenever you do come out to him, have contact information for [PFLAG](http://www.pflag.org) (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and some other resources, to give to him.  (I also recommend the book *Always My Child* by Kevin Jennings.)

I am not a psychologist, therapist, licensed crisis counselor, or anything like that.  I still strongly encourage you to find someone to talk to, in person or on the phone, and to do some research online or at the library.  And find another therapist.  Not because she thinks you coming out is a bad idea - it might be, it might not - but because it doesn't sound like you feel supported by her.

Good luck to you."

A good chunk of the internet hates you and can hardly tell the difference between you and 9gag. The reason you don't see it is because it usually avoids this site entirely.

I'm sure most of reddit would agree but the le shit needs to stop. Once thats taken care of, move on to purging the rage novels.

There are intelligent Christians and Republicans in this world, and there is a political world beyond reddit. Republicans have some good perspectives on some things, and some Christians/Catholics/Whatever aren't all about the silly mythology and more about living your life as a good person. Reddit does NOT have all the answers, and you'd be surprised on what you'd learn from others. Open your minds.

The reddiquette is majorly ignored and the upvote downvote system is terrible for comments is fucking awful and you damn well know it. I immediately cruise down to the downvoted section because I can guarantee reading an intelligent argument (usually one poor soul is being gang banged by the hivemind) is far more interesting then ""LOL ARROW TO DA KNEE"" or ""HIVEMIND COCK SUCK COMMENT""

Verbally abusing your loving friends and family over facebook, or even the kitchen table because they said ""Thank God"" or something completely unconfrontational is possibly the worst thing I've seen come out of mankind. Especially if youre still in high school. I don't care how right you are. My father is the most brilliant man I've known and all the advice he's given me has hardly been wrong and he's a pretty hard core catholic.

Insulting 4chan or SomethingAwful or wherever by calling them ""fat losers who live in their moms basement"" does not make your site better. In fact, it makes it worse.

[Insane misogyny numero uno](http://puerarchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheFuturist_TheMisandryBubble.pdf)

&gt;The Western World has quietly become a civilization that undervalues men and overvalues women, where the state forcibly transfers resources from men to women creating various perverse incentives for otherwise good women to conduct great evil against men and children, and where male nature is vilified but female nature is celebrated. This is unfair to both genders, and is a recipe for a rapid civilizational decline and displacement, the costs of which will ultimately be borne by a subsequent generation of innocent women, rather than men, as soon as 2020.

I'm quite excited to see this apocalyptic nonsense work itself out. Funny how similar to a cult this already sounds.

&gt; The difference between men and women in maturity, however, is that while females mature earlier in life, they also stop maturing at around the age of eighteen, as Schopenhauer aptly observes. And while men don’t catch up to women’s maturity until they reach around age twenty-eight, after that the men keep maturing - often throughout their entire lives.

Women are literally children amirite? A sixty year old feeeeeeeeemale is less mature than a twenty year old man.

[This might be my favourite - a rant formatted to look like an academic paper written by F Roger Devlin, a white nationalist: nommer drie](https://dontmarry.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/sexualutopia.pdf)

This one, I couldn't even pull out a quote from. Pages 14-16 are his account of why all date rapes are not in fact rapes. It made me feel physically sick.

So in summary, the Western world is on the brink of collapse because of women, women are infantile children who are incapable of maturing past 18, and date rape is just the result of bad decisions that women should suck up and let happen to them (according to a white nationalist).

I don't think it is naive or unreasonable to demand and expect our government to stand-up for Chen's human rights by offering him asylum.  The reason our government sold Chen out is because it was in the best interest of commerce rather than individual human rights or civil liberties.  

What is naive is to expect the craven, Wall Street cozying Obama administration to do anything other than what it did-- to coerce and decieve Chen into voluntarily leaving the embassy as a win-win outcome.  It ends the diplomatic incident, allowing the economic talks to go on smoothly and it makes the Chinese look bad on human rights.

Now, this dog had either a [cut tail](http://photo.sohu.com/20040803/Img221334946.jpg) or a super tight [corkskrew tail](http://0.tqn.com/w/experts/Bulldogs-2360/2010/12/Kirbys-tail.jpg) and was the most utterly lazy dog I ever had the chance to get to know.

Being fat and lazy he spent most of the day sitting on his ass. Why he didn't lie down, I do not know. It could have something to do with his upbringing or the fact that he would roll onto his side due to the size of his belly every time he lay down.

Interestingly enough, as a result of sitting on his ass for the better part of his entire life, his tail had somewhat deformed. It was pressed flat from the pressure of the dog and at that point resembled a flap covering his asshole.

Furter more, every time he got up - the flap would lift away from his rectum and a *toot* of the most terrible nature would emerge. Something must have crawled up and died in that dog, because every fart was... Hard to describe, but the *best* description would be a symphony of horror.

When we discovered this feature, it was instantly named ""the assflap effect"". Now, you would think that we would try to leave the poor dog alone but no. In a momemt of curiosity I tried to lift the flap.

*toot*

I tried to press the flap.

*toot*

And with that the ""Assflap Effect Fart Button"" was discovered.

One day when my friend and I were out taking the dog for a walk, we met another dogowner and her small Jack Russel like dog. Now this dog was something else. While Assflap would just stand around looking confused the Jack Russel would jump around, tease Assflap and run away. Of course our dog were to lazy to play.

Suddenly the Jack Russel mounted the far bigger dog from behind and starting to hump. Naturally the smaller dog didn't reach up to do anything and his owner tried to assure my friend that ""It's about dominanse, it's nothing sexual"".

""I don't care, if he keeps it up, he's gonna hit the button.""

""The button?.. I thought you said it wasn't a bitch?""

""No, the fart button. With his chest.""

I think the other thing that prevents adoption is that there aren't many published workflows that work well.

&gt; As for midfield again we only need one marquee signing. Hererra is already having a tough time getting games and unless he leave I can't imagine bringing in two midfielders this summer.

We may only need 1 ""marquee"" CM, but, in my opinion, we clearly need another good squad player if we're going to play 3CMs regularly, because Fellaini is simply not good enough to play CM for us. I want him sold ASAP.

&gt; As for wingers we really only need one additional winger, or we risk stunting Januzaj development even more than we are doing now. Valencia and young are great cover at both wing and wing back.

Young is just about adequate, but Valencia would be basically hopleless as a RW in a 4-3-3. I'd be happy to get 5mil for him in the summer."

17 Consider just one example of the good that can come when a family loyally

upholds Jehovah’s decree not to associate with disfellowshipped relatives. A

young man had been disfellowshipped for over ten years, during which time his

father, mother, and four brothers “quit mixing in company” with him. At times,

he tried to involve himself in their activities, but to their credit, each member

of the family was steadfast in not having any contact with him. After he

was reinstated, he said that he always missed the association with his family,

especially at night when he was alone. But, he admitted, had the family associated

with him even a little, that small dose would have satisfied him. However,

because he did not receive even the slightest communication from any

of his family, the burning desire to be with them became one motivating factor

in his restoring his relationship with Jehovah. Think of that if you are ever

tempted to violate God’s command not to associate with your disfellowshipped

relatives."

However drag is very much over-the-top and larger-than-life, outlandish makeup, crazy outfits (pink beards). Cross dressing can be anything from wearing xgender's clothing while not reflecting any change in personality all the way to assuming the role of the other gender (temporarily, or else you're getting into transgender). So you can think of cross dressing as putting on clothes of the opposite gender, where as drag is putting on a costume and is a real over-the-top performance, usually emphasizing comedy (sexual comedy).

She was blonde and petite and since I didn't know many people there I agreed. My only vehicle at the time was a motorcycle, so I left early to purchase a helmet for her so that she could ride with me. 

I arrive at her apartment, which is kind of sketchy looking. No lights on in her place or outside, and when I knock on the door an intimidatingly large guy answers it, looking sleepy and annoyed. He yells for her and she comes out to meet me. We introduce ourselves and then take my bike to a nearby sushi place. When we get off my bike she tosses me her helmet and declares ""I fucking hate motorcycles!"" She then proceeds to tell me about being drunk and falling off of one a few months earlier. 

As we're walking into the restaurant I ask a bit about where she grew up and she mentions a tiny town a couple of hours away and that ""she had to get out of there"". She then mutters something about fighting two cops and being on probation. I gently press her on the details and she explains that her parents called the cops because she was fighting with her sister and when they arrived to subdue her she ended up kicking one of them. She had been drinking Jack Daniels mixed with tequila at the time, which she claims ""tastes like candy.""

Before I go any further with this tale let me say that I love bad dates. I love the moments when disaster appears imminent and you can almost hear the clackety clack of the rollercoaster climbing the hill before gaining speed and sliding off the rails. So despite (or because) of the things she's already said, I'm having a great time.

We sit at the bar and order drinks. I order a cocktail, she orders a Patrón, neat. The bartender serves us and she downs the shot in a flash. ""Another?"" asks the bartender. ""Of course!"" she replies. When the bartender turns his back she leans over and whispers ""I'm so glad he didn't card me."" I feel a shiver of panic. ""Why?"" I ask, ""How old are you?"" 

""18,"" she answers. I am almost certain her profile said that she was 21.

The evening continues. She downs at least 4, possibly 5 shots of Patrón in less than two hours. Her mood alternates between manic and sullen. When we step outside to smoke she pulls close and kisses me. She's cute, but nuts, and drunk, and I would rather be anywhere else, and yet I'm fascinated by where this is going. Something in me senses that the best is yet to come.

I'm correct. Inside again we discuss how to spend the rest of the evening. We consider going to a nearby bar, or to the movies, but then she gets really excited about the possibility of going to a convenience store and buying some Spice. 

This is the result of a conversation in which she declares ""There's legal pot.""
""No,"" I reply, ""that isn't pot.""
""There's legal pot!"" she insists. ""There's even legal meth.""
""No. There is not legal meth.""

In any case, I'm trying to get her home safe as soon as possible so that I can meet up with my friends and tell them about this disaster of a date, so I agree to take her to a convenience store. When we get there she hops off my bike and says ""I need to piss."" I tell her that I'll take her home right after this, but she waves off that idea and disappears behind the store. The convenience store has Spice, but it does not take cards and I don't have any cash. She decides we should go to the convenience store on the next block to see if they do. 

So we walk down to the second convenience store and run into a different huge guy that she used to live with. Upon seeing him she lets out a shriek and jumps onto him with a huge hug. I am awkwardly introduced to the guy. The second convenience store does take cards, but does not have Spice. Instead I buy a flask of tequila and walk out. As she follows me out she turns to her friend and shouts ""YEAH I GOTTA GO, THIS IS MY FUCK FOR THE NIGHT!"" Then she turns to me, wide eyed, sensing, if not knowing, that a mistake had been made. The expression on her face was priceless. By this point I'm becoming annoyed. 

I drive us back to her apartment, which is still completely dark. I try to say goodnight and have a nice life, but she insists that I come in. In the journalistic interest of this story having an ending, I relent. As we walk up to the front door she realizes that she doesn't have a key and then bangs on the window until the annoyed, sleeping roommate rises (again) to let us in. She leads me into her bedroom and lights a cigarette, the first time I can remember being allowed to smoke indoors in years or since. I excuse myself to use the restroom, and once there finally realize that the reason the place is so dark is that the electricity is turned off. Like Vincent in Pulp Fiction, I stare at myself in the dim mirror and say ""You're going to go out there, say thank you, I had a lovely evening, and then you gonna leave."" It becomes apparent while washing my hands that there is also no hot water.

I enter the dark hallway and make my way back to her room. I open the door. She's lying on the bed half-naked. The bottom half. Her pants are in a pile beside the bed. ""GTFO!"" my inner Vincent pleads.

But I don't. Instead, I light a cigarette and take a sip of tequila. Then I sit on the foot of the bed and say ""So I'm going to go...""
""Just stay!"" 
""No, I really..""
""Just... hold me.""

So this is a girl who is clearly fucked up, and who just happened to meet someone who doesn't actually want anything from her and isn't interested in offering much more than a couple of drinks, conversation, and kindness. I wonder for a moment how often that happens in her life. With a sigh, I toss a blanket over her and then lie down on it and next to her. She moves restlessly and her legs are kicking of their own accord. I wonder what she's coming off of. If only we had some legal meth! After a while she mutters something I don't quite catch and falls asleep. I gather my things and creep out of the apartment. As I pull my bike out of the driveway and onto the road, I'm grinning ear to ear. The worst dates are the best stories, and I was fully aware that I had just gotten one of each.

tl;dr: went out with a girl with way bigger problems than me, doesn't matter, didn't have sex.  
  
&amp;nbsp;


  
Bonus bad date since you liked that one so much:

I once went out with a girl in Portland whose every word was withering and cynical. There was literally nothing I could say that did not elicit sarcasm or dismissiveness. At first I chalked it up to nerves or insecurity, but then it got meaner, and then it just got ridiculous. So I decided to salvage things by coming back at her as biting and aggressive as she was being. When she (jokingly?) asked how long I'd been gay, I looked at my watch and said, ""about 40 minutes now."" 

Later I made a stillborn joke that genuinely seemed to bother her, and she explained that she worked as a nurse and had recently transported a stillborn baby through the hospital on a gurney. I asked if it was just lying there for everyone to see and she said no, that they covered it in a soft little blanket. Without a second thought, I asked ""Is that because the baby was cold? Because presumably... (I grin at her, anticipating my victory) it.. was.. cold."" In response, daggers shot from her eyes and she asked for the check. 

But the strangest moment came at the very end, when we stood outside the bar to say farewell and she said ""So when do you want to go out again?"" I was speechless. Through all the awfulness, the sarcasm and the meanness, she seemed to believe that things had been going well.

**Update 1:** Thank you guys so much for your kind comments and reddit gold. I really did not expect this response. I have about a half dozen completely outlined ideas for books, but the one chronicling my dating and relationship misadventures just shot to the top my priorities. Rilke said that loving another person is the most challenging thing any person will ever do, and I totally agree. But before you even get to that you have to meet them, which can be almost as difficult, as proven by this thread.

**Update 2:** Because I'm sure you're all wondering, here is the stillborn joke I told the second girl:  
  
When she asked if I had any siblings, I said:  
""Well, I have a younger brother...""  
(she feigns interest)  
""...he was stillborn...""  
(a flash of sympathy)  
""...but my parents decided to keep him...""  
(sympathy turns to fury)  
""...people ask me if it was strange growing up with a sibling who was.. dead...""  
(she's shaking her head now)  
""...it wasn't that strange. My parents taught me to treat him like any other baby...""  
(she looks around for the bartender)  
""...and we did! We'd take him to the park, push him on the swing, toss him down the slide.. I mean it's not like he ever cried...""  
(her eyes narrow)  
""...but I give my parents a lot of credit. They decided no matter what, they were going to raise him right...""  
(she stares at me blankly)  
""...and they did: as a stillborn-again Christian."" 

**Update 3:** I've been asked by several folks for more of my writing. I do have something on the subject that's a few years old, and it might be my best worst date of all. I've posted it over at /r/datinghell because it wouldn't fit in the comments. Enjoy?

Cyclocross race, staggered start. As a Junior racer, I jumped off the front with another guy right off the gun, and prepared myself for the mass passing of ~100 35+ and 50+ riders. Got to a muddy off-camber section not yet 3 minutes in, already passing like mad. My competitor squeaked by a 50+ rider, I attempted to do the same (calling out respectfully)...nope, cut off and bumped into a wire fence. Alright buddy. ""Comin' right instead!"" Move past, he takes no heed of my warning and swerves right into me, taking us both out. My competitor (eventual winner) turned into a distant speck. I yelled at the guy for messing with the front of the race. His response? ""Don't take it so seriously."" 

Finished the race mainly bothered by the swelling in my face from his tire, noticed at one point my leg was bleeding but paid no attention. 40 minutes later I finished 3rd (dammit) and was advised to go the med tent...lady's eyes got real big. Scrubbed the shit out of that thing....didn't hurt until the adrenaline wore down. Cue visit to the ER, 22 stitches, awkward bandaging for a couple weeks, ruined season.

***

In Japan, there was never a thought of surrendering before Germany. In 1944, the German military attache in Tokyo reported that the entire country was mobilizing as the tide of war turned against it. He reported the determination of the ""Japanese Army and the circles it influences to go through with the war without compromise on the side of Germany.""

The Portuguese minister to Japan reported in May 1944 that ""the fortification of coasts and mountains continues, giving the impression that this country, like Germany, is disposed to prosecute the war to its very end without the least probability of victory.""

In June 1944, Swiss minister Camille Gorge observed, ""Japan does not expect to win, but is still hoping to escape by prolonging the war long enough to exhaust [her] enemies.""

As Frank concludes: ""... no matter how desperate the situation, Japan intended to fight to the bitter end."" This was apparent as early as spring 1944, before the beginning of the strategic bombing campaign.

By 1945, it was clear that things were nearing an end. Japanese minister to Switzerland Shunichi Kase reported in April to Tokyo that he had ""rather concrete knowledge"" of a plan for Hitler (or other top Nazi leaders) to escape Germany to Japan on a long-range aircraft. On April 12, the Japanese military and naval attaches in Germany asked for a long-range aircraft that could fly from Norway to Japanese territory (likely over the pole to Manchuria, overflying the Soviet Union). The plane was to carry a German assistant air attache and one other passenger. The flight did not take place.

Kase later pushed for peace from his post in Bonn, saying that he had interviewed three Swiss banking officials who said ""Japan is not an object of world-wide detestation like Nazi Germany,"" and therefore should make a peace offer.

In late April, Tokyo radioed its officials in Europe, asking them to report ""as fully as possible"" on the last stage of resistance in Germany ""in order to furnish reference material for the Decisive Battle."" This was a reference to the expected invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The attache in Lisbon was told to pay particular attention to the training of civilian militias and what effect the direct participation of the German High Command and Hitler in combat had on civilian morale.

Magic intercepts in spring 1945 revealed instructions from the Japanese foreign ministry to its diplomats in Moscow. They needed to know what Soviet intentions would be following the surrender of Germany. The cancellation of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact on April 5 was seen as a sign that the Soviet Union would enter the war sooner, rather than later. Secretly, Stalin had promised Churchill and Roosevelt that he would enter the Pacific war within three months of the German surrender.

On April 30, the Supreme War Leadership Council met and decided ""to continue the war until the objective of the Greater East Asia War is achieved. To that end, Japanese diplomats were given instructions to try to feel out Soviet officials and see what the price would be to prevent the Soviet Union from entering the war. Barring that, they were to discern when and if the Soviet Union would enter the war. 

Not until August 2 did these instructions shift, and diplomats began tentative feelers to see under what circumstances the Allies would end the war.

Publicly, Japanese officials announced their intentions to fight on to the conclusion of the war. Kantarō Suzuki, the Prime Minister of Japan, declared in a radio announcement on May 3 (the day after Hitler's suicide) that the Japanese people should continue fighting with the spirit of a kamikaze pilot.

Shigenori Tōgō, Japan's minister of foreign affairs, stated: ""German actions [will] not affect the Empire's determination to pursue the war against the United States and Britain.""

On May 9, the day after Germany surrendered, the Japanese government declared that its objective the war was self-preservation and self-defense, so therefore Japan should be even more determined to defend itself against the United States and Britain, regardless of the situation in Europe.

Heck every phone I had 6-8 years had that feature. 


**Siri** which is considered one of their best piece of innovation has been a part of Android for years. The difference was the Siri talked back making you feel important while Android's voice search could do everything the first Siri could without talking back at you like an annoying GPS robot which we are already sick of already. By the time Siri started doing useful stuff Android's voice search had already been improved even more and I still find it more useful than Siri as it has better engines and apps supporting it which are easier, more productive and refined unlike Apple's apps which I got sick off in a day.


Nearly every single feature they pick up from ancient devices or even those currently in the market and they call it iCum etcetera to sell it. Yes it sells and thats their achievement but it really bothers me that these fan boys then have the nerve to call out other companies with better products and more innovation out by ""rytin lyk dis"".
I predict **Iphone5** or whatever it will be called will have something along the line of ""iDisplay"" letting you to some extent change the display of your phone which you can do in nearly every even ancient phone. How Apple ""just works"" I'll never know. thats like saying Windows 98 ""just worked"". The stupid phone does not even give a crash report when an app stops working and instead hides it like I never opened the app in the first place. Android is honest and lets you know the app has a problem so you can message the developer or just close it or even wait.

I had an iPhone 4s and a 3gs. I've also had the lowest end HTC and currently one of the best Android's in the market. The fact of the matter is that my cheap ass HTC running on android 2.3.5 did so much more than what you can ever do in the iPhone. It was also faster, more customizable and everything took less steps to do which is 100% opposite to what Apple fans say that ""it just works"". 

You think the iPhone ""just works""? Watch this 5 part video series if you've never had an Android and if you will still believe an apple ""it just works"".

Anyways yesterday I landed on an amazing quote by Rothbard given in the introduction of ""Theory and History"".

&gt; For while many people are aware of the long and lone struggle that Ludwig von Mises waged against statism and on behalf of laissez-faire, few realize that there is far greater resistance in the economics profession to Mises' methodology than there is to his politics. Adherence to the free market, after all, is now not uncommon among economists (albeit not with Mises' unerring consistency), but few are ready to adopt the characteristically Austrian method which Mises systematized and named ""praxeology.""

I could not agree more with that. I spent my initial years with Austrian Economics thinking that mainstream economists hate Austrian economics for its libertarian leanings, but that's not true, the conclusions of Austrian Economics are quite acceptable to many people(as long as you don't say they are coming from Austrian Economics), its the Austrian Methodology which everybody in Economics profession hate.

Calling it homeopathy of real economics is much more easy than actually making a point against it. My graft with mainstream economics(and I would sincerely be excited about something like that) if it considered time preference or time as a factor, if everything is seen from a lens of single timeframe that's what really turns me off about mainstream economics. This is why the supposed pro-free market school ""Chicago school"" is as annoying to me as Keynesian school of economics. And inconsistency is another point against them(this is something where Maxian ideology scores higher than Keynesian/neo-classical economics).

But of course lugkuv65v4u65 you don't have to reply to any of the real criticisms you can just go back to making jabs about how Austrian Economics has no more consideration than [Phlogiston Theory of Fire](http://www.slate.com/id/9593/) or how is it the homeopathy of real economics.

You do realize that for a non-decided observer comments like ""homeopathy of real economics"" against constant attempts to hold a valid conversation sounds like that the former person just doesn't know his shit. You would be much more effective if you could think of a valid criticism and stick to it than saying things like ""Austrian Economics is the homeopathy of **real** economics""."

My uncle and I were finishing up chopping/gathering firewood for my grandmother because it was getting dark.

I completely froze. My heart felt like it was beating out of my chest then completely stopped when I heard a *tap tap* on my window. My uncle sped up and was loudly praying in my native language. I didn't know what was going on and thought it was over till our truck suddenly dipped from the bed. My uncle then started saying, ""Look at me"" and ""Don't turn away"" over and over. Then I heard it again, *tap tap* but from the window behind me. It was getting harder for me to breathe and I wanted to cry. A minute or two passed and the truck dipped again. My uncle looked around and sighed. It was quiet besides the truck and the road. He looked at me and said, ""We will ask your father to do a prayer in the morning. So the evil will forget our faces.""

6,27397,Emily.,Greg.,Jamal.,Lakisha.,720.0,"Well, I'm going to do the downer thing.

When I was in 7th grade, I decided to play football. Just because I didn't have much else to do other than sit my ass on my computer all day and I have always liked it (For you Brits here, I will say this once, and only once. Football=Egghand) so I figured wtf, why not. Fast forward to my Freshman year in Highschool. I fail algebra. Whooptidoo. To continue football, I have to pass, so I take it in summer school. When I am there, I meet this amazing girl, beautiful, and smart. She took the quote ""I never let schooling interfere with my education"" to heart. So were in the class, we talk a little, nothing major. So on the last night of summer school, the football team throws a party (nothing like having most of the team in summer school) and I bring her along. We're there, having a good time, and someone busts out some beer. Party time. We drink. We make out. We pass out. The next morning, her parents are at my door, and my parents are calling my cell phone freaking the hell out to find out where she is. How my school district did summer school, was they pooled all of the students and drifted them around round-robin to the 7 high schools in the district, and this summer it was my high school's time. I had no clue if I was going to see her again, because she was in the band and theatre, and was thinking about killing off band to focus on theatre. She told me before she met up with her parents she was going to stay in band to try to see me again (made me feel awesome!), as long as I played football. We stayed in touch over email and whatnot, and I saw her when we went to play at her school, etc. This went on for sophmore year. I considered us dating at this time, as did she. Usual fun stuff happened over summer. Hang out, drink, but no sex at this point. My junior year I got injured in Football. Bad. I was a center, so I got beat down alot in the games. During one of the games, I got in my usual stance, and the QB decided to run behind me but slipped in the mud. His helmet went into the back of my knee, causing my foot to stay where it was, and my body to fall back. It tore my knee up. She took a week off of school to be by my side at the hospital.


It was during this week of hospitalization that I thought I want to stay with her for as long as possible. I had 3 months of bi-weekly physical therapy (not needed medically, but to have a chance at playing again) she was there. She ended up dropping band because of this. All it did was reinforce this fact that I wanted to stay with her. End of my Junior year, she decides to go visit her father is Moscow. She was born in Russia, but moved here when she was 3 months old, so she had a Russian passport, etc. She was going to be there for the entire summer, which was fine with me. Gave me time to dick around on my computer. Before she leaves, I decide I might as well make the foolish choice to propose. She said yes, all that good stuff, blah blah blah sappy story about how amazing it was to hear her say yes, blah blah blah. So she goes for the summer.

August rolls around, and its time for her to come back, I know shes on the plane, and about the time she should be back. Memphis Intl has horrible cell reception, so I assume she is still working around customs there. I get a call from a blocked number. Knowing she is supposed to call me, I answer. Its her. Shes crying. I can't make out what she is saying for quite some time, but I distinctly make out ""denied entry"". It finally clicks- shes been denied reentry into the United States. I can't fathom why she was, but she has been denied reentry and is being forced to return to Moscow following an appeal process than can take months. After talking her through it, she gets cleared to stay in a hotel for the night, and take the first flight back in the morning.

So she is back in Russia, and all we can do is talk every chance we get. Im going apeshit in school at this point, preparing for a midterm exam that is going to kick my Senior ass. So one night, shes on the phone with me, and then she suddenly stops talking. Stops responding. Stops being herself. I call her dad, who rushes home to find her passed out on the floor. She gets taken to a hospital over there, and I am going nuts worried about her. After a couple of days, it turns out she has a tumor on her brain that is putting pressure on her skull/brain. They take a biopsy, and wait for the results. Malignant. My world is shattered, and I can't even begin to think about how her parents are thinking. At this point, her mother pawns a bunch of stuff and flys out there. I don't know what to think, and sure enough, they operate. First one is fine, goes well, but it was just an exploratory/preventative surgery- designed to stop the growth, but won't help at all. They get the information to get the tumor out, but its deep in her brain. She won't be the same person, and possibly even motor functions. She decides to go on. I talk to her before the surgery. She is scared, and is worried about how I am feeling.

She comes out of the second surgery fine. She can walk and talk just fine, but she has some issues with memories of middle to high school. She doesn't remember me. She knows that I am important- she has a ton of pictures to show her that. So we are talking on the phone, and she knows my voice, knows it to the point it comforts her, but doesn't know where she knows it from, or why she feels this way. They run some tests- they need to do another surgery.

They start to do this one. She starts out fine, and then....they lose her. They noticed that her vitals were starting to fade, and they immediately began to attempt to save her life. Long story short- they don't. I get a call in class from her mom. She dies on the table. Her will stated that she wanted to be buried in Moscow, so they plan on having the funeral when I can attend (that weekend), but in a bitch move decide to have it during the week when I can't attend. They also decide to forgo the traditional 3rd, 9th, and 40th day services. So basically I got shafted out of the memorial service for my fiancee. I'm devastated, as you can guess. I decide to not deal with her mom anymore. It affects my school to the point where I can't graduate if I did everything to pass, so I drop out. I get my GED, and have been in between jobs ever since.


Thats really the best thing I can say about my life. Nothing else of note. I sit around and dick around with my computer. But everyone has that one defining event in thier life. This was basically what caused me to be me.

I was asked if I would change anything. Nope. To change one thing, changes me. And even with that- I love myself.

I went into this one, which name I cannot remember, and descending the stairs. I went in and looked around and then noticed a door on the back saying you needed tokens. So, I went to the counter and gave the guy a couple of bucks and went into the back with my tokens. I found a booth that worked, and didn't notice the hole next to the seat. I put the quarter in and saw the older 80s/90s gay porn stuff. Really 'vintage' looking and quite boring. 

Then I hear a whistle. I look down and this tongue was flicking in and out of the hole. I said ""Nooo..."" in a long drawn out way and he backed up. I heard a zip come undone and he stuck his dick, and balls, through the hole. I didn't know how to react.

A virus that can be removed easily or fails to spread dies out and another virus (religion) replaces it. 

It isn't enough to do good to go to heaven, it is a requirement by the virus that you have the correct version of the virus running and you accept it and only it.

Much like a parasite often alters the behavior of the host, as does a religion when people become hostile at just the thought that the virus/religion/parasite may be the wrong one.

When one religious group tries by force to remove the other religion  the people will fight to the death protecting their version of the religion, sometimes even if the strain is only slightly different.

It is through understanding this behavior that Christianity was able to succeed with the Jews.

Matthew 5:17  ""Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill"" 

The reason for this passage wasn't because the Jesus actually supported the old testament but because people are unwilling to replace their religion, but tell them their religion is true and you can prove it, but you have a few more rules to add and suddenly you have replaced their version of the religion in the only way possible.

The virus doesn't take with a small amount of people, these people tend to question everything by nature and prefer evidence for claims. These people are a glitch in the system called Atheists and often go into technical and scientific fields because if their nature.

Life is short and people are afraid of death, people want nothing more than to believe with every fiber of their being that it isn't really over when their time is up so they don't like ""atheists"" trying to get them out of their comfort zone and questioning religion. It is THE most uncomfortable subject for them ever. They'll kill and even risk their lives to protect this utopian view of life after death so it is nothing to shave a few people out of their social circle they once called ""friend"".

In this information age the role of traditional religions will be challenged by knowledge but it is probably true that most people have a ""god sized hole"" in their hearts because if for no other reason they are secretly terrified of death.

To drjalexanderphysics's friend  (just noticed physics in the name) his friend's decision represents more than just a lack of acceptance for drjalexanderphysics's lack of religion. drjalexanderphysics represents his absolute worst fear and something he at some level already knows but chooses not to accept: That some day he is really going to die."

CPU performance is a hard thing to measure reliably. Flash Player doesn't have anything built in that tells you, so if you want to approximate you have to run some custom CPU test like run an operation over and over and measure the time it takes. Unfortunately there's no way to know if the user has a bunch of other apps running at the time, and of course these things can change with no notice at all (a user might be encoding a video one day and not doing anything else the next so you get wildly different results).

There are many things that contribute to playback stuttering. Since you specifically said ""regardless of buffer"" I'm assuming that you are talking about actual decoding + displaying of the video (you never see the loading spinner appear, the video is just choppy or low fps).

Some things you can do to get better playback performance:

1) Make sure you have the very latest Flash Player. 10.0.45.2 is the current version from adobe. Upgrading from Flash player 9 to 10+ will give you a pretty decent improvement, and adobe is always working on improving video quality (despite all the hate they've made really good progress lately).

2) Don't have a bunch of browser tabs open. We've found that having a few tabs open with misc. websites can affect playback. This means the browser has less CPU cycles to decode your video and it could stutter. Also take a look at what other things you have running on your computer. Also check your task manager and see if there's something in there taking up more CPU than it should.

3) Watch a smaller sized version of the video. Are you trying to watch 1080p on a laptop that has a small screen? Try dropping down to 720p or 360p. Does that help? (also see #5)

4) Watch the video in fullscreen. Especially the HD sizes will perform much better when they are in fullscreen because we can take advantage of Flash Player's hardware scaling + hardware acceleration (on some platforms).

5) Watch a video size appropriate for the size of the video player and/or your screen. I often see people selecting an HD sized video but leaving the player at the 360 size (that's the small size on youtube.com). This is just silly. You are downloading this *giant* video and then making your computer scale it down to display it at 360p. It not only wastes your bandwidth, but wastes your  CPU cycles since the player has to decode the giant video frames and then ends up throwing out most of the data anyway. Also don't watch a video size that's bigger than your screen. If your laptop is has a 1024x768 screen, that's not even big enough to show 720p widescreen video at it's native size. The player will have to scale it down to fit (720p video is generally 1280x720px) You'd be better off watching the 480p size and you likely wont notice much quality difference. In your account preferences, there's an option to ""always play the lower quality videos."" This might be a good option if your computer is slow.

56,13740,,,,,100.0,"First off, apologizes on the unfortunate (or fortunate?) circumstance, I've been there and it sucked but for a moment (now happily married to non-crazy chick). 

Second, I originally spent $2,000 on the ex-engagement ring, not to mention the band which was another $500 or so. Now I realize it's to late but I figured if anyone else finds themselves in this situation I have some advice on how to get the most out of the sell:

1. Save the ring. Don't pawn it off or sell it to the first jewelry shop you enter. However if it hurts like hell knowing the damned thing still exists like the ""One Ring"" than go throw it into the fires of ""Mor-First-Jewlery-Shop-You-Come-Across-dor"".

2. Wait. Wait until you find ""The One"", no not the jewelry shop but the girl of your dreams (trust me, she'll come around).

3. Once you've dated said girl for the appropriate amount of time and would like to ""put a ring on it"" just give her the old ring... No stupid I'm not serious, that'd be preposterous and mean.

4. Figured out what the girl wants for a ring and go to a jewelry store. Now I'm not in the jewelry business, but from what I understand is many of the ""Name Brand"" jewelers have ridiculous mark up. So instead find a local owned jewelry store or five.

5. Shop around, I know you probably know this but it's worth mentioning. Once you've found the perfect ring at a reasonable price go into the store and see if you can trade in the ring toward the price of the new one. If the ex-ring has good diamonds sometimes the jeweler can use the old diamonds and therefore cutting some of that cost. Also they can melt the gold down and ""buy"" it from you toward the cost 

6. Profit. Maybe, this method takes a little bit of involvement and haggling. I shopped around local jewelry stores until I found one that was honest and willing to put the cost of the old ring toward the new one. 

Anywho, dunno why I felt like I need to share that. If it's not clear let me know.
