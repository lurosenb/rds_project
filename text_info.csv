348,"The show sucks, and it has little to do with hivemind taste. Since *Seinfeld*, sitcoms have been evolving past the two-arc (A dominant, B ancillary) method that so many older sitcoms played off of (All in the Family, Three's Company, Lucy, etc.). 

Seinfeld was quick paced, witty, and introduced chaos and complicated multi-layered plots (like George lying about being a marine biologist and Kramer hitting golf balls into the ocean, boom beached whale, etc. etc.) to television audiences that made older sitcoms feel stale. Look at the sitcoms to follow--*Malcolm in the Middle*, *Arrested Development*, *The Office,* *30 Rock,* *Modern Family*, *Sunny*, *Community*, *Parks and Rec*, all are/were successful, and follow the Seinfeld model. All also appeal to a younger audience, and for the most part were/are considered edgy.

CBS as a network panders to an older audience. Shows are more formulaic (2.5 Men, Raymond, TBBT, dot dot dot) and to the average audience feels repetitive, recycled, and stale.

More detail: In the US, the death rate for 45-54 year olds in 2004 was [423.1 per 100,000](http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=587), or 0.423%. (It's lower for younger people over 1 year old, and higher for older people. For those 25-34 year old Redditors, it's 100.5 per 100,000, or almost exactly my erroneous orignal 0.1%. Cool! For 15-24 year olds it is only 0.08%) 

40% more likely than 0.423% (age 45-54) is an increased death rate of 0.169%. (Back to 0.04% for 25-34 year olds.) So there's an estimate of the order of magnitude of the increased likelihood of death. It's still small for most of us, but age dependent. For those 85+, the US death rate is almost 14%. 40% more than that is 19.6%.. almost 6% higher. There's a difference worth noting.

From what I've seen of people installing standing desks in my office, you could be more likely to give yourself a concussion adjusting the desk height than you are to prevent your death.

I'm sure (some) extreme sports have a higher increase in all-cause mortality than sitting all day.

You should get up, move around, eat right, get exercise and all that, but you shouldn't stress over sitting on your ass and not having a standing desk unless you have a lot of other risk factors. 0.04% to 0.169% is not a huge increase.

That's why we didn't have piles of dead office workers in the streets as we moved away from manufacturing and farm labor a hundred years ago.

Edit: Adding a link to [Cornell Ergonomics Lab](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html) (hat tip to harlows_monkeys), with an actual useful discussion of the ergonomics of the situation. Turns out standing desks may not be so great after all if you just stand there motionless all day. I guess there's a lot of history with factory line workers standing all day.

Edit: [greenthoughts](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/sldyp/a_study_of_more_than_200000_australians_adds_to/c4f4b3j) clarified the meaning of hazard ratio. I was lead astray by a quick search on the internet. So, the absolute risk is not something we have. However we can estimate the magnitude of it by using overall death rates, as above.",31,3171,494,589,104,2677,3,78,2289,882,190,196,0,229,0.11007653061224489,Pretty positive,Positive,0.47620937263794405,Objective/subjective,Objective/subjective,0.8678343949044586,Bad,Bad

388,"The knock hung in the air for a second, and I hesitated to move. The knock repeated once more, and my heart suddenly was in my throat. I sat for another second or two, as that rotten sound reverberated around the room. This all happened in an instant. Slowly, I slid my hands backwards, getting them into a suitable position to shove myself upwards and out of my chair. My back was to the door, and as I eased myself out of my seat, I began to pivot to face the door, and the source of this hideous sound.
Just then I thought I heard another knock, but the sound quickly grew into a crash. I was promptly showered with splinters and bits of drywall as the door burst off of the hinges and the walls surrounding it also gave way. With the incredible shock of this new development, as well as the sheer force of the crash itself, I was knocked backwards onto the ground.

 I opened my eyes as the dust cleared, and sat staring at the bulbous, bleeding shape staggering into my room. Some sort of demon, was it? The blood sloshed around his transparent head, spilling out of the top and badly staining what was left of my walls and carpet. Foul demon, why have you come here?

Then I noticed his stagnant, hideous grin.

It was the Kool-Aid Man.

And he had broken through my wall.

It wasn’t blood. It was just Kool-Aid, and his body was simply the familiar glass pitcher with a friendly smile. I remembered his commercials almost at once, and just as quickly, the fear subsided and was replaced instead with incredible excitement.

“Ohhh Yeahhh!” He said, in that familiar, gruff, yet laid-back voice of his. “I got just the thing for a kid on the go like you to hydrate himself!”

He chucked a box of Kool-Aid at my head from his white-gloved hand.

“But I’m not a kid on the go…” I tried to explain as the Kool-Aid smacked my cheek and fell harmlessly to the ground. “I’m 27 years old! And plus, it’s a nuclear holocaust outside! I can’t even leave my room!”

The living pitcher just stared at me.

Ever smiling, as his sugary lifeblood sloshed around inside his head. Or was it his torso?

We continued to blankly stare at each other, my words hovering between us for what seemed like an eternity.

Vile creature!

Foul deliverer of children’s drinks!

What did he want from me?

Was this the form the angel of death had chosen? Is he finally here to deliver me to The Beast?

His horrible unblinking eyes stared, judging my soul, and I, The Last Man on Earth, suddenly felt a pang of regret for taking The Last Hit of Acid on Earth.

We sat there for twenty minutes, unmoving, not speaking. The Kool-Aid inside him eventually settled, as he stood statue-like in the remnants of my doorway. This demonic staring contest had no end.

I eased my hand backwards towards my chair over the course of this time, slithering my arm closer and closer towards the only semblance of a weapon nearby – the wooden leg of my chair. 

There was nothing I could do, after all.

It was apparent that the Kool-Aid Man had to die.

My adrenaline kicked in, and in one swift motion, with only one hand, I managed to completely tear off the leg of my chair. Screaming, I leapt to my feet, expecting some sort of reaction from my visitor. He did not move.

Filled with a sudden, divine power, I charged.

Never having learned exactly how to defeat a post-apocalyptic, hellspawned commercial spokeman, I chose the tried and true method – the stake through the heart.

I swooped in on him, and delivered my righteous chair leg through the center of his face, in lieu of the heart. The glass shattered much too easily, almost like an eggshell, leaving a gaping hole in his face. Kool-Aid gushed from his body; still he stood. I gasped, bathing in the liquid pouring from his evil figure. It was remarkably viscous Kool-Aid.

A moment passed. My hair and clothes were now dyed red from the Shower of Beverage.

He didn’t react. He just stood there as the Kool-Aid drained from his system. Still grinning; mocking me. He had to die, now more than ever.

It wasn’t until the last drop had left his head that he finally dropped to his knees. Deliverer of happiness… ever smiling. I backed away from his huge torso, and immediately, that hideous grin went slamming into the floor.

His head completely shattered. I was left with nothing but a pair of arms and legs, and a puddle of Kool-Aid so deep you could bathe in it.

I panted for a moment, relieved, and then I chucked my impromptu weapon onto his battered corpse.

Then I went into the kitchen and fixed myself a delightful glass of pink lemonade, and a Hot Pocket. They were good, but I forgot to put a plate under the Hot Pocket, and some of the filling dripped out into my microwave.",64,4715,832,881,129,3883,0,1,3661,1054,141,374,0,292,0.14295153236914598,Pretty positive,Positive,0.46368719664174207,Objective/subjective,Objective/subjective,0.9723593287265548,Quite good,Good

The picture is of a flaming astronaut walking across [6th Avenue in Manhattan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Avenue_\(Manhattan\)).

He thinks that these budget cuts will separate America from her past achievements in space, specifically the lunar landings, as evidenced by use of a lunar space suit. He blames this on business and commercialism, as evidenced by the situation of the burning space suit in Manhattan. He feels that space is being ignored, and has become just another humdrum thing that people see and forget about. It's just another pedestrian in the crosswalk, and Crossing is pointing out that space is so much more.

429,"Cards like Reverb/Veng/**Curse of Stalked Prey** are force amplifiers. They strengthen the cards you already have.
The reason they are bad in RDW is twofold.  

1. RDW relies on every card in your deck getting you 'Closer' to your objective. Reverberate/Increasing Vengeance/Curse of Stalked Prey all require you to have other things to be successful. It then requires a balance of burn spells/other spells in order to be effective. Reverberate is useless without something else to target. Veng is useless without something of YOURs to target. (CoSP is useless without creatures to swing after its up).  
If you get one of those cards late in the game, they can't win you the game because you might not have anything to amplify to greater strength.  
2. You don't have the resources. RDW is about efficiency. All of your spells want to be lightning bolt or goblin guide (Pretty much).  
If you have cards in your deck that make you stronger, but take you mana/a turn to cast, you might not get enough value out of it compared to running another threat or another burn spell.  
Imagine casting T1: Stromkirk, T2: CoSP, T3: Chandra's Pheonix. By the end of T3 you have: a 5/5 and a 3/3. You've dealt 6 damage to the opponent in three turns. Now the opponent stabilizes with a wrath.
Compare it to T1: Stromkirk, T2: Nothing, T3: Chandra's Pheonix. By the end of T3 you have: a 3/3 and a 2/2. You've dealt 5 damage to the opponent in three turns. Now the opponent stabilizes with a wrath.  

The difference in those situations was a minor growing buff if you're already winning. In the second scenario, you could've used a burn spell to ensure your creature connected, dropped another creature or something else. Curse of Stalked Prey takes development time.  

Going into the second part of 'Resources' is what you top out at. RDW kind of wants to top out at 3-5 lands. While you don't have the mana to Reverberate/Vengeance one of your spells, they are dead cards. They are card disadvantage, card disadvantage that might just lose you the game.  

This kind of got a bit long winded.  

tl;dr: They trend towards card disadvantage because you don't have the resources/cards they make stronger.

**Edit**: Maybe I should have just linked directly to this article instead. Too late now.

Lansing - House Republicans prohibited state Rep. Lisa Brown from speaking on the floor Thursday after she ended a speech Wednesday against a bill restricting abortions by referencing her female anatomy.

Brown, a West Bloomfield Democrat and mother of three, said a package of abortion regulation bills would violate her Jewish religious beliefs that pregnancy be aborted to save the life of the mother.

""Finally, Mr. Speaker, I'm flattered that you're all so interested in my vagina, but 'no' means 'no,'"" Brown said Wednesday.

Brown's comment prompted a rebuke Thursday by House Republicans, who wouldn't allow her to voice her opinion on a school employee retirement bill.

""What she said was offensive,"" said Rep. Mike Callton, R-Nashville. ""It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women. I would not say that in mixed company.""

Brown's comments were published in Thursday's Detroit News.

Majority Floor Leader Jim Stamas, R-Midland, determined Brown's comments violated the decorum of the House, said Ari Adler, spokesman for the Republican majority.

""If I can't say the word vagina, why are we legislating vaginas?"" Brown asked Thursday at a hastily called Capitol press conference. ""What language should I use?""

Brown noted ""vagina"" is the ""medically correct term.""

""We're all adults here,"" she said.

The House tabled a bill Wednesday that would ban all abortions after 20 weeks with a narrow exemption for the life of the mother after passing a bill with new regulations for abortion providers.

House Republicans also wouldn't let state Rep. Barb Byrum speak on the House floor today.

Byrum, D-Onondaga, caused a disturbance on the House floor Wednesday when she wasn't allowed to introduce an amendment to the abortion regulations bill banning men from getting a vasectomy unless the sterilization procedure was necessary to save a man's life.

""If we truly want to make sure children are born, we would regulate vasectomies,"" Byrum told reporters Thursday.

457,"So when will you actually start to improve the technical quality of the service to the point that it could actually compete with fansubs?

I've been following the site and the technical quality of the service you offer for a long time, and there have been hardly any improvements after the site went legit.

* You offer 720p video, but you use 1500 kbps bitrate for every single thing with mediocre x264 encoding settings. The result is that basically every single show on CrunchyRoll has [notable banding in the video](http://i.imgur.com/Fgg2s.png) (compare this to a [HDTVrip](http://s3.postimage.org/napro745e/streaming_quality_comparison_tv.png) of the same thing) and as someone who watches anime on a 1080p screen it is very notable and bothersome. Beyond that, I've seen plenty of encoding errors pop up every now and then, [like this one just last season](http://i.imgur.com/mKrhL.png). Can't you use variable bitrate (CRF mode in x264, so that more demanding episodes get more bitrate and less demanding episodes get less) or at least bump the bitrate up to 2000kbps and use better compression settings?
* On another note, a friend of mine (who is an audio nut) has also noted that the AAC encoder that you guys use is pretty terrible. Japanese TV broadcasts tend to have better audio quality, and their AAC encoders aren't that top-notch either.
* The subtitle renderer has hardly improved at all. Because of its limits, typesetting is also incredibly bare. I see some subbers actually try to at least rudimentary typesetting within the limits of the renderer, but most subbers don't seem to even bother and just put the sign text into some edge of the video in the same font as the dialogue. Well-done typesetting can really enhance the anime-viewing experience, so it's honestly a shame that you have to resort to illegal alternatives in order to basically get any. Compare [this](http://i.imgur.com/Zonlp.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/0zcl4.jpg) for example. Or [this](http://i.imgur.com/z9Okx.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/kxf5B.gif).
* And speaking of fonts, is there any particular reason why you stick to core web fonts and Trebuchet MS for every goddamn thing? It can't be an issue of money, since there are tons of free-for-commercial-use fonts out there that work great for subtitles. Just check out [FontSquirrel](http://fontsquirrel.com) for example. Another annoyance with CR in comparison to local file playback is the fact that if the subtitle styling on CrunchyRoll is terrible (not enough vertical/horizontal margin, font is tiny, [inappropriate threeliners](http://i.imgur.com/S9Z0e.jpg)) there is absolutely nothing that the user can do about it. With local files, I can at least change the dialogue styling to my liking.
* And last but not least, please add chapters to your videos. Considering the pathetic buffering capabilities, it would help a damn lot if you could skip past the OP/ED with 100% accuracy just by pressing a single button. This is once again a feature fansubs have offered for years yet not streaming service seem to have catched on.
* EDIT: One more thing - the quality of timing. The timing quality seems to have been quite terrible this year. Many series have the subtitles timed so that continuous lines have annoying gaps between them, which are very jarring and distracting. Scenebleeds also seem quite common. I guess one reason scenebleeds could happen is that the watermarked workraw that the translators have to work with might differ by some frames from the final video that goes up on CR, in which case I guess you'd need to educate the companies providing the video on the matter. Anyway, beyond that, especially this season (2011 Spring) the timing has had atrocious mistakes. Take Astarotte's Toy for example - many lines are split in completely awkward places, resulting in linechanges practically mid-word. There have also been mistimings where the the timer timed a line into a previous line, leaving the actual line completely unsubbed. My Ordinary Life also had the same, which resulted in one of the infamous ""?""-lines. You guys really ought to have some quality control for the people you hire for the subtitling jobs. Or just have proper quality control in general - there's been way too much post-release patching for major fuckups this season.
* There's also one thing a friend of mine has complained about - the translation of GOSICK. It seems like the translations for different episodes are done by approximately three different translators, and they're completely inconsistent in their terminology and translation ideology. One doesn't leave any Japanese honorifics into the translation (which makes total sense, since the show takes place in a pseudo-French setting), one keeps honorifics in, and one *adds honorifics in where there are none.* The last one also seems to do quite a lot of translation errors. All in all, since he's a big fan of the series, he can't help but feel very disappointed about the substandard it seems to be getting on CR.

I mean really, it's just pretty pathetic to see CR being stuck technically in the year 2007-2008 while fansubs are truly in the year 2011. I'm not even asking that much of you; I know you can't realistically reach the same level of typesetting as the best fansubs have because the CR subtitle renderer would have to be at least as capable as VSFilter/libass to achieve that (and I don't see that happening anytime soon). Get some variety to the fonts, make all the subbers do typesetting at least to the degree that can be done with the subtitle renderer, add some new features to it so even more can be done, if you can't increase the bitrate of video try adding a debanding filter to the Flash player (no idea how hard this would be to do technically, though), add chapters... At that point I'd probably stop watching the illegal releases for their better quality and just use CrunchyRoll for my anime needs. Or well, at least I'd regularly pay for a subscription and play the episodes in the background while I watch the HorribleSubs rips, since I like to watch my media locally.",42,6123,990,1058,164,5133,4,20,4867,1256,254,426,0,383,-0.0286125541125541,Pretty negative,Negative,0.4359515900765901,Objective/subjective,Objective/subjective,0.9007569386038687,Pretty good,Good

His expression and delivery of it seemed to say, ""I can't believe you actually used this insipid canard in a presidential debate, you complete child, what is the matter with you."" I know some people are going to bemoan more silliness stealing the show, but it honestly was an extremely powerful moment to me. It reminded me of the style of absurd dark humor used by Joseph Heller in Catch-22, Terry Gilliam in Brazil or Stanislaw Lem in some of his writing, where goofiness and hilarity is perfectly mixed with horror and gravity. 


It was like the president was stepping back from this whole political game to say, ""what the fuck?""

488,"Nope, because the water doesn't touch the main nerve in the center of the tooth.

Fun fact: Narwhals practice dentistry! It's normally the younger, subordinate narwhals practicing on the older, senior narwhals. If a senior narwhal has his horn broken then the main nerve is exposed and shit hurts. A subordinate narhwhal will proceed to break off a small section of his tooth into the open hole of the senior's tooth creating a ""filling"" of sorts.

Edit 2: This is from a Marine Mammal Biology textbook written E.C.M. Parsons. He's an amazing guy who really knows his stuff. Its titled *An Introduction to Marine Mammal Biology and Conservation*... [And here it is on Amazon and people want to look further into it.](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Marine-Mammal-Biology-Conservation/dp/0763783447) I know it was partially free on Google Books or whatever, but I don't feel like really searching for it. Here is an excerpt:

&gt; ""A type of dentistry may be practiced among narwhals in that the broken tusk of one individual may be plugged with the tip of another's tusk. Although some have described this as being the result of ""head-on collisions"", this is unlikely considering the accuracy that would have to be involved (or, more precisely, the extremely low probability of such collisions occurring coincidentally). Because this ""capping"" of the tusk is unlikely to have happened by chance, it is possible that this is an altruistic act. There are accounts by Arctic indigenous people of seeing young narwhals aligning the tips of their tusks with the broken tusks of older males and, apparently, deliberately snapping the very tips of their tusks off to block open tooth cavities. A narwhal's tusk is hollow and filled with pulp and contains a sizeable nerve, which is exposed would presumably be extremely painful. One could see why this unusual behavior might develop in a social cetacean species. roken tusks have also been found with the tips crammed with sand and gravel, perhaps from an attempt to cap the broken tusk by jamming the broken tooth into the seabed.""

490,"&gt;idea that every male at war is a homosexual. 

At this point I realized that you are white, male and straight. Rape in prison and the army is never done by men who are in their everyday life homosexual. It is always hyper masculine stereotypical alpha males who do it to show their power over others. 

People who I have talked to that served in old Yugoslavian army would tell stories about how once someone was found out to be gay they would be beaten, bullied and humiliated until they more often than not killed themselves. Less than 5 years later this same army would go on and rape some 80% of prisoners in the concentration camps it was running. 

As for the point you and everyone else has made that we don't have statistics from medieval times on male rapes during war that is true. However we do know that for most of the period homosexuality was punishable by death. We can draw comparisons to societies where that is the case for women today: for example Saudi Arabia has one of the worlds lowest recorded rape rates, much lower than anywhere in Scandinavia for both men and women. Yet any GNO working there will tell you that it is possibly as high as one in three. I picked Africa because it is poor enough that the niceties of modern society haven't penetrated there much and war there would be closest to what medieval war looked like. However it would still be a vast improvement since the standard of living even in the Kongo is much higher than it ever was in medieval Europe/Westeros.

&gt;Rape is perfectly fine to include, but GRRM isn't dumb enough to go too overboard. 

He has a woman raped by 50 men in less than a few hours. I'd say he goes overboard whenever possible.

494,"The Ouya is NOT a mobile device. Your PC can do what the OUYA does. Your phone can do what the OUYA does. But developing a console game for EITHER of those devices is stupid. The OUYA opens up the console market for indies. Indes CAN develop games that can ONLY be played with a controller and release them to the android market right now. You know how many people are going to pay for a game FOR THEIR PHONE that can ONLY be played when they have a ps3 controller and TV handy. Nobody. Because that is a small fraction of the time their phone is available. For somebody that buys an OUYA they are paying for a CONSOLE. Not a phone hooked up to a TV. A console. 

The Ouya has plenty of other kool aid properties but your sole argument is the single most naive one. A console that sells 38k copies is not a huge market. An Indie game will probably only ever appeal or be seen by maybe a quarter of that. It's specs will likely be out of date by the time it's even released and since its customizable devs will have to develop for the original specs or risk not being compatible with modded ouya's. And at the moment an stable online community is a lot of money to maintain. Who knows if the Ouya team can create or afford the infrastructure to maintain that network. 

But at the same time. People want this. The XBLA has a high entry point and developing for the PSN costs a lot of money to get in. Being able to develop an android game for a console is a huge deal and if the OUYA takes off at all this will be huge for indie developers and even if it doesnt we've all just proven we want an indie console and albeit small there is a market out there if a company is willing to shell out the money. People are skeptical because they are unproven. If Sony or Microsoft or Google made this device with everything 100% identical people would eat it right up.

513,"I see this claim every time a Krugman column is on reddit, so I'm going to post a generic reply.

&gt;He said the fed needs to create a housing bubble to keep the economy going!

Prediction, not request. 

Question: if Krugman wanted a ""bubble"", using and meaning those exact words, then [why did he call for action in 2005 when it was clear that the housing market was in, and I quote the exact term he used, a ""bubble""](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/08/opinion/08krugman.html)?

Actually, it was McCulley that first called Greenspans' bubble; Krugman merely paraphrased him. **Here is the original quote Krugman referred to**:

&gt;There is room for the Fed to create a bubble in housing prices, if necessary, **to sustain American hedonism**. And I think the Fed has the will to do so, even though political correctness would demand that Mr. Greenspan deny any such thing.""

Question: is the above speaker genuinely hoping that Greenspan will create a bubble to sustain ""American hedonism""(yay hedonism!), or making a prediction about what he'll probably do?

&gt;He said there should be a new bubble to replace the old one on Spanish TV!

Now this is getting really dishonest...**Krugman was quoting [the Onion headline](http://www.theonion.com/articles/recessionplagued-nation-demands-new-bubble-to-inve,2486/) about people looking for a new bubble**. The quote on Mises is hacked up with ellipses, and they refuse to provide the entire thing unedited. But you can read what Krugman thought of the Onion article on his blog. He sees it as a statement of the market's frenzy to find something new to throw their money at. [Here's Krugman referencing the Onion in his blog around the same time, very obviously referring to absurdity of it and not, as Mises claims, using it as a guiding economic policy.](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/state-of-the-onion/) As the person he linked to said, ""[If it wasn't so sad, it would be hysterical](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/07/headline-of-t-1.html).""

&gt;He called for interest rate cuts in 2001! That proves it!

They say he ""must"" have meant it because he called for interest rate cuts in 2001, when the economy was in a slump. They seem ignorant of the fact that both the fed and the economists that offer advice for them re-assess interest rates every 6 months or so.

&gt;Ok then, but he DID want the housing boom to drive the economy

If you take that to mean Krugman wanted a bubble, it appears to be based on a confusion between what a speculative bubble is and what an economic driver is. While they can go hand in hand, the two are different things.

In layman's terms, a ""bubble"" seems to have become synonymous with ""any big boom in the economy, which will inevitably come to an end with a backlash"". If you believe in Business Cycle theory, you're very inclined to think that, since that concept is fundamental to the theory's model of how the economy works (Boom-Bust).

But a ""bubble"" is not defined as ""bad shit that happens after seemingly good stuff happened"". A speculative bubble is defined as ""trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance with intrinsic values"".

In other words: Investors drive up the price of a good. Others, seeing the price rise, assume it must be a great investment, driving the price up even further. This cycle continues, until someone tries to sell the good at the (ridiculously overvalued) price. When people are unable to sell, the price drops to realistic levels, and all the money people had on paper vanishes. And worse, if they bought the good at the overvalued price, they're in debt with no way to recoup. (I'd like to point out that as much as Austrians worship gold, it's perfectly possible for the above scenario to happen with that good, too).

However, bubbles do not have to go hand in hand with economic drivers. It's perfectly valid for a housing boom to stimulate the economy...if houses are actually needed, and of benefit to people who genuinely need to buy them and are willing and capable of getting them at the market price. The problem is when prices move out of sync with what the market can bear. And that is where the fed can step in.

You might disagree with that, and believe that *any* manipulation in interest rates will inevitably lead to a bubble, and that therefore anyone that believes in the power of the fed wants one. But keep in mind, when you say that, you go against 100 years of mainstream economic thought, not just this guy specifically.

523,"""In fact, there are numerous other channels (other than potential decreased employment) through which the higher wage is absorbed:

–profits: to the extent that the increase is paid for out of profits, we shouldn’t expect job losses. And in an economy where profits have dazzled while paychecks have fizzled, that ain’t a bad thing.

–prices: some studies find that a small bit gets passed through to higher prices.

–productivity: to the extent that higher wages reduce turnover and vacancies, a higher minimum can partially pay for itself by squeezing out such inefficiencies. It’s not wishful thinking—some studies have found just that.

–reasonable rates: it matters what the level you raise it to, and historically, increases have affected less than 10% of the workforce, often even smaller shares. With relatively few in the “affected range” we wouldn’t expect to see large distortions.

–it’s stimulus! Minimum wage workers tend to spend the extra cash, so there’s more economic activity than otherwise would occur—btw, even under the redistributive scenario described under “profits” above, you’ll get this effect if low-wage workers consume more of their last dollar than those in the sky boxes.""

That leaves roughly :22-24 seconds on the clock and gives you time to go to the sideline and discuss BOTH upcoming plays.  3rd down should be a pass, and if incomplete you still have time for a fourth down play, and that fourth down play can be a run or pass.

Here's why this isn't ""appeasement"" and why the alternative is ""trolling"": Google does not regularly publish photos of Mohammed, Jesus, God, or other religious/controversial figures on its homepage. It's offensive to Google's users and its employees, some of whom are religious non-violent Muslims, Christians, and Jews. It would also put those employees in real danger. Choosing to step out of its way to incite others because ""they can"" or whatever absolutely is trolling. It's also going to offend 1 billion people, 99% of whom are not extremist.

Since then, I've voted more Blue, Kerry, then Obama, and since Virginia is the 2nd-most likely tipping point state after Ohio, that matters more than ever.

Somehow, psychologically, voting for the guy who *might* have won, probably avoiding Iraq, seems like it would have been more comforting than voting for a guy who never could have won that year.

2000 was a unique situation where I could have voted for the guy who won the popular vote and lost the election, and that doesn't happen much.

After a minute or so, a guy with down's told her to shut up, at which point she pulled the phone away, turned around and yelled up at him ""shut up, you fucking retard"" and then finished her call... nothing happened after that, except obviously she made an impression on the guy. 

After the movie finished, as everyone's assembling on the stairs to leave the theatre, she was standing in the middle of the stairway facing sideways, talking with a friend. (I never understand why ""friends"" can't tell someone to stop being idiots, isn't it embarassing to them to be seen with these kinds of people?) 

The Down's guy came down the steps, stopped a step or two above her and yelled out: 

This!

Not 40 years ago, it was commonplace for farmers to cull the heard of their farmcats by putting them in a sack and drowning them.  It sounds cruel by current standards, but let's face it - the animals are going to die at some point in the near future anyway if there isn't enough food to go around, or if people are going to throw them into the wild at that young an age, or if the get taken to an animal shelter in a rural area.  [""56 percent of dogs and 71 percent of cats that enter animal shelters are euthanized. More cats are euthanized than dogs because they are more likely to enter a shelter without any owner identification. ""](http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/fact-sheets/animal-shelter-euthanasia.html)  It's a terrible truth, but one way or another, those dogs were very likely to die.  Plus, fuck reddit for holding someone from another country (this is based on the comments here) responsible for your hipster, privileged belief structures.  Someone said croatia - which is a war-ravaged country.  Frankly, those dogs were probably done a favor rather than starving to death, freezing to death, being eaten, or getting blown up by stray Serbian landmines.  

EDIT:  I did not do my research on Croatia and assumed it still faced similar problems as the other post-Soviet Yugoslav states.  I still have not done research, so, to the extent that I have miscategorized Croatia (which I will point out I don't know if this girl was from there, I merely read it in someone's post), I apologize.  HOWEVER - the point remains the same that this is not uncommon in many places, may not carry the same social stigma in said places as it does here on reddit, and therefore it is unfair for any of us to judge the person acting based on our set of social mores (with an accent of the ""e"", thanks).

557,"True, everyone does have a right to free speech. Though, taking an extremely aggressive stance with your free speech really benefit anybody? The cartoon sounds as though it is essentially mocking Muhammad, and what is the value in that? The western world has been at odds with the middle east for a long time and mocking the most revered prophet in that region will do nothing to fix that tension, in fact it will most likely only further the problem. Imagine if a picture of Jesus Christ as a dog was published in a major news publication in the US. There may be not murders (that's reserved for abortion doctors), but there surely would be protests. 

And yes, there is a hypocrisy due to the presence of anti-western cartoons in the Middle East, but aren't we the ""bigger man"" because have free speech and civil rights? Shouldn't we then act accordingly and not engage in petty attempts to aggravate a people whose region we basically redrew the map for? Imagine after WWII if some outside form just took a chunk out of New England or Western Europe and designated it as a new country with a primarly
 Muslim population. Would Americans not be mad? Would there not be hatred for the power that did that?

You asked how do they know to change gears but I may as well explain the whole thing. PLEASE NOTE THIS CUTS ALOT OF CORNERS TO SIMPLIFY IT.


There are many different systems, but there are 3 main systems (exculding CVT's), hydraulic operated automatics (relatively old school, although still used), computer controlled (allot smoother and more responsive) and Semi Automatic Manuals. 


I will initally talk about hydraulic operated automatics as they are purely mechanical and are probably the most interesting. Natrually in a gearbox you want a reduction in engine shaft speed to or near ground speed (depending on diff ratio). Before I go any further a gearbox is there to multiply torque through changing shaft speeds, it does not multiply power (you can never multiply power). People need to realise that Torque is the abilty to do work and Power is the rate at which I can do it. 


But anyway this is done in an automatic through a plantery gear set (http://appauto.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/planetarygearset.jpg). This consists of a Sun gear, Plantery gear and a Ring gear, and has a few really cool tricks. With a normal gear set we supply power to one gear that turns another thus gearing it up or down depending on the ratio, with a plantery set we have 3 places to introduce shaft speed and we can remove it from the either of the two remianing gears, and we can stop or allow the other remainding gear to rotate. For example 


    Input           Output           Held Gear               Gearing
    Sun             Planet            Ring                       Up
    Planet         Ring               Sun                        Down
    Sun             Ring              Planet                     Reverse


But this only what is called a 2 speed, more 'speeds' are added by using more gear sets either in series or parrellel, they also allow for alot of really cool tricks, most of which are probably outside of this basic explaination, but if you are interested this video gives a good basic understanding (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQhzruw2Qh8&amp;feature=related).


But how do we select which gear is the input and output and which gear is locked? By the use of Bands and Clutches. A Band is literally what it sounds like, its a band that wraps around the Ring gear holding it in place, locking it to the gear box case. The clutch (usual a basket clutch like a motorcycle) perform several functions like locking the sun gear to the input shaft. So by actuating the bands and clutches at different times and what not we can acheive different gear ratios.
.

But now you are probably thinking right so there is a planetry gearbox that is all magical and just magically decides when to change gear. Well this is the cool bit and why I love pure hyrdraulic automatics. Now remember those Bands and Clutches you are probably going but wtf actuates these? Hydraulics, awesomely designed Hydraulics, most people are aware of electronic logic gates, the same exists in hydraulics. I will keep this as simple as possible, as most people get lost here (if I havent already lost you). 


**Answer to Orignal Question** 
On the input shaft of the automatic gear box is a hydraulic pump that produces pressure, on the output shaft (usually) there is a centrifugal governor, basically the faster it spins the more pressure it allows into the hydraulic circuit. In real layman terms this is what selects each gear. But realality is far more awesome, remember how pressure is related to speed? well it is also related to strain on the gearbox, this is how in some cases it knows how to change down (not all gearboxes use this but). This Pressure is then sent into a hydraulic circuit that uses what I will call logic gates, depending on flow rate and pressure and the current engaded circuit it opens pressure into a piston that then forces onto a belt or a band or some combination, hence selecting the right gear. Here is an example of a cirucit (http://www.seekic.com/uploadfile/ic-circuit/2011912639162.gif), seem simple right? Yeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh. They are even funner in real life (http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/automatic-transmission-brain.jpg)


Now Remeber how I said this is the old school type of auto? Neither of the photos I just gave was of a Old school auto (I think) they dont really seem right, but this is only an explaination so they are good enough for a reference, I cant find any ""good"" old photos.  Now this why I am not a real fan of modern automatics. They use the ECU and usually take input such as brake pressure, engine rpm, gearbox speed, throttle position (and even rate of application) and even things like steer angle in some, then operate electric actuatuated that allow pressure onto pistons that acutuate the bands or clutches etc etc. Smoother, more effiecent, yes, but the awesome hydraulic circuits are sadly gone.


Now probably thinking sweet this sounds good (or your head has exploded), but what is this Torque converter I hear so much about? Up until this stage I have not mentioned anything about how we engade or disengade drive at idle. Right, imagine a boat propeller, it spinning moves the boat forward? Yes, now imagine if we held the boat stationary, it would move the water. right? now magine if we put a second propeller in that water and held what ever it was attachted to stationary, the propeller would spin. This is this the basis of the torque converter, although with less boating action (sadly). 
A really good video (again from the 1950s and the US army) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8EHTTNPEg). But this is the cool part, a torque converter as you probably imagine from the name, multiples torque, but it varies with the relative speed of the two impellers (its what the earlier propellers are actually callgger difference bigger torque. Torque converters also cause the slop you usually notice in auto's as fluid is being acted on a impeller and then acting on another, this all has mass (hence inerita) and takes time to act.etc etc


More sportier and in my experience most modern cars then use a clutch in the middle of the torque converter, this allows the torque converter to do its thing  like allow the engine to idle and multiply torque off the line, but then at high rpms it locks the torque converter together (and thus negating it) meaning better throttle repsonse and better fuel economy (no losses in the torque converter). Random side note this is usual given as the reason for why Americans used to drive big v8's and alike, torque converters were intially very inefficient and very heavy requiring big engines to move then around.


And finally Semi-Automatics especially in really expensive cars, are just normal manuals that are just controlled by the ECU. Efficient? yes. Quick to change? Hell yes. As big of a mind fuck? Not really.


**TLDR (everyone):Hydraulic pump makes pressure depending on speed, this then acutates a piston that selects a gear. Some unicorn blood may or may not be involved. Watch the videos linked above**
Also if you have any other questions, I really dont mind answering them.

If Hillary Clinton is named the Democratic nominee, remember, she did it by attacking the rights of black people to vote in Presidential primaries.

Look for a massive push by Hillary Clinton's camp to ""reseat"" delegates from Michigan and Florida, which were taken away by the DNC previously.  

Florida is probably similar, but I'm in Michigan, and I can tell what I feel is happening here.

Michigan is home to Detroit, which has about 900k people, 700k-ish of which are African American, in a state of about 10M people.

Some months ago, it was clear that Obama was Clinton's #1 competitor. If he was even marginally successful, Detroit's vote, along with other cities with large/majority African American populations, such as Flint or Grand Rapids, would give Obama an easy victory in Michigan, and despite our losses, we're still a top 10 state.

So, our Governor Jennifer Granholm, who endorses Hillary Clinton, agreed to hold an early primary (Jan 15, 2008), probably knowing that Hillary Clinton's friends within the DNC would then cut our votes out of the Democratic Nomination, eliminating this advantage for Obama and giving Clinton the edge she needs. Michigan Republicans, seeing a chance to make the Democrats look bad by ignoring Michigan voters, agreed, and the changes sailed through.

And that's exactly what happened.

Clinton broke her pledge not to campaign here, stayed on the ballot when all of the other democrats pulled out, and won a pointless victory.

Now there is talk that our Governor Granholm is joining the Clinton administration, for all of her ""help"" in ""winning"" Michigan.

""help"" in suppressing the black vote.

And we can expect Clinton to push hard to make those delegate votes count again.  Delegates selected without the favored candidate of the likely majority of Democratic voters.

It's just another way to ""keep the black man down""

576,"sorry but you are wrong. Germans were better of in 1943 mid-war then 1933 when hitler was elected. A lot of taxcuts and retirement payments had been established, and sureley the money and land formely owned by the jews was not that bad either. 
The support for Hitler was simply the need for a leader after 1929 were everything broke apart, most of the germans were willing to hate jews if it ment they would live better, and since jews were hated ever since in europe(UK france spain italy and surly germany) it was not that hard to keep up. So the enemy was found.
The sentece ""Germans were never ""manipulated""."" is just plain wrong. No country or men is plain evil and does things just for the cause of it. It takes propaganda (goering) and a desperate need for unity to create an environment in wich people start to behave like that.

577,"I was asked to asked to sleep with a 16 year old girl.

Back story:

I used to work for one of the largest plumbing and fixture companies out there.  When the housing market crashed the CEO decided he'd rather keep his jet and slashing IT payroll is one of the easiest ways to save money.

Decided I had had enough of depending on other people to keep my job, a friend of mine and I opened up our own shop.  Had a logo, motto, mission statement, the whole ball of wax.  Pretty proud of it.  Even though I've since moved on, I kept all the swag like cup holders we made.

One of my best clients early on was a man of Lebanese decent who spoke very little English.  He usually dropped his computer stuff off at my place to have it fixed and then would pick it up the next day.  He had 3 kids and a wife and no matter how much I taught him how to avoid getting viruses he'd keep getting them.  He was very kind and often brought me some of his wifes cooking so I started just doing work for free since he didn't have much money and they were typically quick fixes.

About two months in I get a call from him and he needs me to come over and remove parental controls he had accidentally put on his computer.  He needed me to come as his car was low on gas, he didn't have money to get gas until Friday so he needed to conserve.

I go over and during the course of removing the offending software, his daughter comes and sits next to me.  We had talked about her only briefly and he said that she was studying to be a nurse.  She was absolutely smoking hot, wearing a pretty revealing tank top, short skirt.

She looks early 20's, mabye 22. One thing about me.  I look young.  Very young.  When I shave I look like I'm 20 and I'm 31 now, was 28 at the time.

She asks me about myself, my business, what I'm interested in, stuff of that nature.  I spend more time talking to her then paying attention to the laptop.  There's some pretty obvious chemistry between us.  Eventually she asks me if I have a girlfriend.  I said no, I don't.  She said do I want one.  I said if the right girl comes along.  She smiled and scooted closer to me.

After a couple minutes of sitting there trying my best not to pop a tent I realize that I'm not going to be able to get the computer fixed on the spot.  I'll need a boot CD to remove the software and had left it at home.  I explain it to her, she goes and explains it to her dad.  He nods and asks if I can return it the next day after 4 PM.  I agree.

I spend that night furiously purging myself.

The next day comes and I head on over, repaired laptop in tow.  I knock on the door and the girl answers, impossibly wearing even less then the day before.  She lets me in and I put the laptop back and start to boot it up.  It's then that I notice a book bag on the floor with a bunch of obviously high school text books.  I look at the girl, then back to the bag of books and ask her what grade she's in.

Sophomore.  In High School.  She's 16.  This smoking hot slightly ethnic girl who wants to jump me is 16.  My mind is screaming to get the fuck out of there.  I thank her, decline payment for the repair and leave.
 
Two days later I get another call.  The laptop won't go online. I head over and that's when the girls mother finally introduces herself to me.  She says, ""Ah, this is the man my Carmila goes on about!  You are a fine looking young man indeed!  She is quite stricken by you!""

I smile, thank her for the compliment.  Fixing the laptop only takes me a minute. It's a simple wireless kill switch issue on the laptop.  While confirming that it works now, I notice the girl peeking at me from her bedroom.  She looks at me and licks her lips and makes a 'come hither' gesture with her finger then smiles and closes the door.

I sigh and leave wondering why she couldn't be 18.

A few nights later the girl calls me at round 9 pm. She says the laptop broke again and she needs me to fix it right away for school work.  I summon my best professional integrity and show up.

I take a look at the laptop.  Someone had managed to jam a SD card into the slot the wrong way.

Now, I don't know if any of you know this, but that's pretty hard to do even with a hammer.  She spends a great deal of time showing off her cleavage to me, brushing up against me, touching me.  Her mother is in bed and her dad is at work. I tell her I'm not comfortable with this.  That I think she's very pretty, I admire her ambition but I'm too old for her.

She smiles and nods and sits down nearby and behaves herself.  I fix the laptop and leave.

Two nights later I'm getting milk from Wal-Mart.  It's about 11 PM.  When I get out near my car I notice someone next to my car unable to start it.  She's a fairly old lady and I offer to help her jump her car.  She thanks me profusely.  As we finally get the engine started who should run up to the car?

It's the girl.  I just jump started her grandmothers car.  She hugs me, a little too tightly. She grabs something she shouldn't.  Not wanting to embarrass her in front of her grandmother I disengage, smile and leave.

A few nights later I get a call from her father, Ricky.  He wants to thank me for helping out his mother and for all the free help I've been giving and insists I come over for a home cooked meal.  I decline but he insists.  I really like the guy so I eventually cave and show up.

I show up and breathe a sigh of relief as his daughter is nowhere to be found.  We sit down to eat and after a few minutes the mother shouts that she can come out now.  She's wearing an absolutely gorgeous dress, her hair is done, she was just...man.  I can't even tell you.  It hurts to think about it.  You want to talk jailbait?  I've never felt so uncomfortable in my life.

It's then that her dad asks me if I want to sleep with his daughter.

I nearly choke.

Her mother laughs.  She smiles and says that they really like me and think I would be a good fit for their daughter and want me to date her.  The girl sits next to me and starts rubbing my thigh.  Her mother says that she wants her daughter to lose her virginity.

To me.

My mind can't handle it.  I excuse myself and leave.  The next day her father shows up on my door, upset that I refused but understands why I would hesitate.  Apparently he had spoken with a coworker who had explained the laws of the US to him.  He said that he would not 'get the law involved.  You may have my daughter.'

Anyways...

2 years later the girl got in contact with me again.  She was now legal and wanted me to be with her.  I was engaged to my now wife at the time.  She cried, saying that she had 'stayed pure for me by her fathers will.'

It's been a little over a year now and occasionally I'll get a friend request from her on facebook or a text message asking if I'm still married.

I am only doing this as part of an altruistic movement to free the world from know-it-allism...can't you see how believers (in their own ego) are worshiping a false god (themselves) and are brainwashed (by their own ego)?????

&gt;Right now, American manufacturing is struggling to fill 200,000 vacant positions. **There are 450,000 openings in trades, transportation and utilities. The skills gap is real, and it’s getting wider. In Alabama, a third of all skilled tradesmen are over 55. They’re retiring fast, and no one is there to replace them.**

&gt;Alabama’s not alone. A few months ago in Atlanta I ran into Tom Vilsack, our Secretary of Agriculture. Tom told me about a governor who was unable to move forward on the construction of a power plant. The reason was telling. It wasn’t a lack of funds. It wasn’t a lack of support. It was a lack of qualified welders.

&gt;In general, we’re surprised that high unemployment can exist at the same time as a skilled labor shortage. We shouldn’t be. We’ve pretty much guaranteed it.

&gt;In high schools, the vocational arts have all but vanished. We’ve elevated the importance of “higher education” to such a lofty perch that all other forms of knowledge are now labeled “alternative.” Millions of parents and kids see apprenticeships and on-the-job-training opportunities as “vocational consolation prizes,” best suited for those not cut out for a four-year degree. And still, we talk about millions of “shovel ready” jobs for a society that doesn’t encourage people to pick up a shovel.

&gt;In a hundred different ways, we have slowly marginalized an entire category of critical professions, reshaping our expectations of a “good job” into something that no longer looks like work. A few years from now, an hour with a good plumber â€“ if you can find one â€“ is going to cost more than an hour with a good psychiatrist. At which point we’ll all be in need of both.

&gt;I came here today because guys like my grandfather are no less important to civilized life than they were 50 years ago. Maybe they’re in short supply because we don’t acknowledge them they way we used to. We leave our check on the kitchen counter, and hope the work gets done. That needs to change.



What people don't seem to understand is:

1&gt; College is overrated, not worthless and people should stop confusing the two terms. Arguing that college isn't worthless fails to make an argument about cost and benefit.

2&gt; You can't make everyone go to school. If at 18 someone doesn't want to do well at college, they won't. This idea that everyone can benefit from ""expanding their horizons"" is bullshit. You can lead a horse to water...

I'm not voting your post up or down because I don't know anything about your situation.  Some questions that should factor into this decision:

1. Has your father previously demonstrated homophobia?  How much?  (Inappropriate jokes?  Statements that homosexual activity is sinful?  Violent comments against gay marriage?)
2.  Are you a legal minor?  Is he your legal guardian?  (If yes to both, he might be able to force you into ""treatment"".)
3.  Whether or not you are a minor, do you rely on your father for housing, food, tuition, or financial support of any kind?  Would you be able to get by if he cut any or all of that off?

If he does have legal or financial control over you right now, and he has expressed extreme or violent anti-gay sentiments, this might not be a good time.  Wait until you're legally and financially independent.  If he shows tolerance around gay rights issues, etc. and you have a strong, open relationship in other regards, it might work.  Unless he already has figured it out (and even if he has) it still will probably be difficult for him to hear this news and work through it.  I recommend that whenever you do come out to him, have contact information for [PFLAG](http://www.pflag.org) (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and some other resources, to give to him.  (I also recommend the book *Always My Child* by Kevin Jennings.)

I am not a psychologist, therapist, licensed crisis counselor, or anything like that.  I still strongly encourage you to find someone to talk to, in person or on the phone, and to do some research online or at the library.  And find another therapist.  Not because she thinks you coming out is a bad idea - it might be, it might not - but because it doesn't sound like you feel supported by her.

Micro - Changes in the gene frequency of a population over time. Modification of *pre existing* genetic information in population. (adaptation)

Macro - Addition of *new* genetic information in a population. Large scale changes linking one kind to another. 

With a Biblical worldview I don't believe that you can believe 100% in the evolution theory. I believe in Micro evolution, 100%. It is proven and there is no disputing it. I don't however believe in macro.

It seems we all agree that Bane was a hell of a badass. He was pretty much unstoppable. He was a symbol of pain and intellect that Batman had never faced before. I saw Bane as the flawless pinnacle of Evil.

And then we hear his backstory, how he loved and protected Talia, and we feel sorry for him. For the first time in the movie, we see Bane as being a human, a normal person with hopes and loves and desires, and we might even feel sorry for him... and then he's instantly destroyed.

A quote from Batman Begins.
""A man is just flesh and blood and can be ignored or destroyed. But as a symbol... as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, everlasting.""
So how fitting is it that once we see Bane as a man, he is destroyed and ignored for the rest of the movie?

[Insane misogyny numero uno](http://puerarchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheFuturist_TheMisandryBubble.pdf)

&gt;The Western World has quietly become a civilization that undervalues men and overvalues women, where the state forcibly transfers resources from men to women creating various perverse incentives for otherwise good women to conduct great evil against men and children, and where male nature is vilified but female nature is celebrated. This is unfair to both genders, and is a recipe for a rapid civilizational decline and displacement, the costs of which will ultimately be borne by a subsequent generation of innocent women, rather than men, as soon as 2020.

I'm quite excited to see this apocalyptic nonsense work itself out. Funny how similar to a cult this already sounds.

[Why women are children: nombre deux](http://no-maam.blogspot.fr/2012/06/woman-most-responsible-teenager-in.html)

&gt; The difference between men and women in maturity, however, is that while females mature earlier in life, they also stop maturing at around the age of eighteen, as Schopenhauer aptly observes. And while men don’t catch up to women’s maturity until they reach around age twenty-eight, after that the men keep maturing - often throughout their entire lives.

Women are literally children amirite? A sixty year old feeeeeeeeemale is less mature than a twenty year old man.

[This might be my favourite - a rant formatted to look like an academic paper written by F Roger Devlin, a white nationalist: nommer drie](https://dontmarry.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/sexualutopia.pdf)

This one, I couldn't even pull out a quote from. Pages 14-16 are his account of why all date rapes are not in fact rapes. It made me feel physically sick.

So in summary, the Western world is on the brink of collapse because of women, women are infantile children who are incapable of maturing past 18, and date rape is just the result of bad decisions that women should suck up and let happen to them (according to a white nationalist).

I don't think it is naive or unreasonable to demand and expect our government to stand-up for Chen's human rights by offering him asylum.  The reason our government sold Chen out is because it was in the best interest of commerce rather than individual human rights or civil liberties.  

What is naive is to expect the craven, Wall Street cozying Obama administration to do anything other than what it did-- to coerce and decieve Chen into voluntarily leaving the embassy as a win-win outcome.  It ends the diplomatic incident, allowing the economic talks to go on smoothly and it makes the Chinese look bad on human rights.

Being fat and lazy he spent most of the day sitting on his ass. Why he didn't lie down, I do not know. It could have something to do with his upbringing or the fact that he would roll onto his side due to the size of his belly every time he lay down.

Interestingly enough, as a result of sitting on his ass for the better part of his entire life, his tail had somewhat deformed. It was pressed flat from the pressure of the dog and at that point resembled a flap covering his asshole.

Furter more, every time he got up - the flap would lift away from his rectum and a *toot* of the most terrible nature would emerge. Something must have crawled up and died in that dog, because every fart was... Hard to describe, but the *best* description would be a symphony of horror.

When we discovered this feature, it was instantly named ""the assflap effect"". Now, you would think that we would try to leave the poor dog alone but no. In a momemt of curiosity I tried to lift the flap.

I tried to press the flap.

*toot*

And with that the ""Assflap Effect Fart Button"" was discovered.

One day when my friend and I were out taking the dog for a walk, we met another dogowner and her small Jack Russel like dog. Now this dog was something else. While Assflap would just stand around looking confused the Jack Russel would jump around, tease Assflap and run away. Of course our dog were to lazy to play.

Suddenly the Jack Russel mounted the far bigger dog from behind and starting to hump. Naturally the smaller dog didn't reach up to do anything and his owner tried to assure my friend that ""It's about dominanse, it's nothing sexual"".

""I don't care, if he keeps it up, he's gonna hit the button.""

17 Consider just one example of the good that can come when a family loyally

upholds Jehovah’s decree not to associate with disfellowshipped relatives. A

young man had been disfellowshipped for over ten years, during which time his

father, mother, and four brothers “quit mixing in company” with him. At times,

he tried to involve himself in their activities, but to their credit, each member

of the family was steadfast in not having any contact with him. After he

was reinstated, he said that he always missed the association with his family,

especially at night when he was alone. But, he admitted, had the family associated

with him even a little, that small dose would have satisfied him. However,

because he did not receive even the slightest communication from any

of his family, the burning desire to be with them became one motivating factor

in his restoring his relationship with Jehovah. Think of that if you are ever

tempted to violate God’s command not to associate with your disfellowshipped

relatives.",8,1171,179,196,33,992,0,1,935,236,24,100,0,56,0.17731481481481481,Pretty positive,Positive,0.6148148148148149,Objective/subjective,Objective/subjective,0.9730941704035875,Quite good,Good

268,"I suppose drag could be classed under cross dressing. However drag is very much over-the-top and larger-than-life, outlandish makeup, crazy outfits (pink beards). Cross dressing can be anything from wearing xgender's clothing while not reflecting any change in personality all the way to assuming the role of the other gender (temporarily, or else you're getting into transgender). So you can think of cross dressing as putting on clothes of the opposite gender, where as drag is putting on a costume and is a real over-the-top performance, usually emphasizing comedy (sexual comedy).

Of course there are people who will disagree with what I said here, but I think it's a solid and general idea that's pretty PC. You'll never find a term that pleases everyone in the LGBTQXYZ community because some people want to avoid labels and others want to have the most specific label possible.

Conchita is a persona of his, however he doesn't consider himself a drag queen and he was quite irritated with the insistence of interviewers and the repetition of the question.

275,"I had just moved to Phoenix, Arizona for work and was crashing on a friend's couch when a girl on OKCupid suggested we meet up. She was blonde and petite and since I didn't know many people there I agreed. My only vehicle at the time was a motorcycle, so I left early to purchase a helmet for her so that she could ride with me. 

I arrive at her apartment, which is kind of sketchy looking. No lights on in her place or outside, and when I knock on the door an intimidatingly large guy answers it, looking sleepy and annoyed. He yells for her and she comes out to meet me. We introduce ourselves and then take my bike to a nearby sushi place. When we get off my bike she tosses me her helmet and declares ""I fucking hate motorcycles!"" She then proceeds to tell me about being drunk and falling off of one a few months earlier. 

As we're walking into the restaurant I ask a bit about where she grew up and she mentions a tiny town a couple of hours away and that ""she had to get out of there"". She then mutters something about fighting two cops and being on probation. I gently press her on the details and she explains that her parents called the cops because she was fighting with her sister and when they arrived to subdue her she ended up kicking one of them. She had been drinking Jack Daniels mixed with tequila at the time, which she claims ""tastes like candy.""

Before I go any further with this tale let me say that I love bad dates. I love the moments when disaster appears imminent and you can almost hear the clackety clack of the rollercoaster climbing the hill before gaining speed and sliding off the rails. So despite (or because) of the things she's already said, I'm having a great time.

We sit at the bar and order drinks. I order a cocktail, she orders a Patrón, neat. The bartender serves us and she downs the shot in a flash. ""Another?"" asks the bartender. ""Of course!"" she replies. When the bartender turns his back she leans over and whispers ""I'm so glad he didn't card me."" I feel a shiver of panic. ""Why?"" I ask, ""How old are you?"" 

""18,"" she answers. I am almost certain her profile said that she was 21.

The evening continues. She downs at least 4, possibly 5 shots of Patrón in less than two hours. Her mood alternates between manic and sullen. When we step outside to smoke she pulls close and kisses me. She's cute, but nuts, and drunk, and I would rather be anywhere else, and yet I'm fascinated by where this is going. Something in me senses that the best is yet to come.

I'm correct. Inside again we discuss how to spend the rest of the evening. We consider going to a nearby bar, or to the movies, but then she gets really excited about the possibility of going to a convenience store and buying some Spice. 

This is the result of a conversation in which she declares ""There's legal pot.""
""No,"" I reply, ""that isn't pot.""
""There's legal pot!"" she insists. ""There's even legal meth.""
""No. There is not legal meth.""

In any case, I'm trying to get her home safe as soon as possible so that I can meet up with my friends and tell them about this disaster of a date, so I agree to take her to a convenience store. When we get there she hops off my bike and says ""I need to piss."" I tell her that I'll take her home right after this, but she waves off that idea and disappears behind the store. The convenience store has Spice, but it does not take cards and I don't have any cash. She decides we should go to the convenience store on the next block to see if they do. 

So we walk down to the second convenience store and run into a different huge guy that she used to live with. Upon seeing him she lets out a shriek and jumps onto him with a huge hug. I am awkwardly introduced to the guy. The second convenience store does take cards, but does not have Spice. Instead I buy a flask of tequila and walk out. As she follows me out she turns to her friend and shouts ""YEAH I GOTTA GO, THIS IS MY FUCK FOR THE NIGHT!"" Then she turns to me, wide eyed, sensing, if not knowing, that a mistake had been made. The expression on her face was priceless. By this point I'm becoming annoyed. 

I drive us back to her apartment, which is still completely dark. I try to say goodnight and have a nice life, but she insists that I come in. In the journalistic interest of this story having an ending, I relent. As we walk up to the front door she realizes that she doesn't have a key and then bangs on the window until the annoyed, sleeping roommate rises (again) to let us in. She leads me into her bedroom and lights a cigarette, the first time I can remember being allowed to smoke indoors in years or since. I excuse myself to use the restroom, and once there finally realize that the reason the place is so dark is that the electricity is turned off. Like Vincent in Pulp Fiction, I stare at myself in the dim mirror and say ""You're going to go out there, say thank you, I had a lovely evening, and then you gonna leave."" It becomes apparent while washing my hands that there is also no hot water.

I enter the dark hallway and make my way back to her room. I open the door. She's lying on the bed half-naked. The bottom half. Her pants are in a pile beside the bed. ""GTFO!"" my inner Vincent pleads.

But I don't. Instead, I light a cigarette and take a sip of tequila. Then I sit on the foot of the bed and say ""So I'm going to go...""
""Just stay!"" 
""No, I really..""
""Just... hold me.""

So this is a girl who is clearly fucked up, and who just happened to meet someone who doesn't actually want anything from her and isn't interested in offering much more than a couple of drinks, conversation, and kindness. I wonder for a moment how often that happens in her life. With a sigh, I toss a blanket over her and then lie down on it and next to her. She moves restlessly and her legs are kicking of their own accord. I wonder what she's coming off of. If only we had some legal meth! After a while she mutters something I don't quite catch and falls asleep. I gather my things and creep out of the apartment. As I pull my bike out of the driveway and onto the road, I'm grinning ear to ear. The worst dates are the best stories, and I was fully aware that I had just gotten one of each.

tl;dr: went out with a girl with way bigger problems than me, doesn't matter, didn't have sex.  
  
&amp;nbsp;


  
Bonus bad date since you liked that one so much:

I once went out with a girl in Portland whose every word was withering and cynical. There was literally nothing I could say that did not elicit sarcasm or dismissiveness. At first I chalked it up to nerves or insecurity, but then it got meaner, and then it just got ridiculous. So I decided to salvage things by coming back at her as biting and aggressive as she was being. When she (jokingly?) asked how long I'd been gay, I looked at my watch and said, ""about 40 minutes now."" 

Later I made a stillborn joke that genuinely seemed to bother her, and she explained that she worked as a nurse and had recently transported a stillborn baby through the hospital on a gurney. I asked if it was just lying there for everyone to see and she said no, that they covered it in a soft little blanket. Without a second thought, I asked ""Is that because the baby was cold? Because presumably... (I grin at her, anticipating my victory) it.. was.. cold."" In response, daggers shot from her eyes and she asked for the check. 

But the strangest moment came at the very end, when we stood outside the bar to say farewell and she said ""So when do you want to go out again?"" I was speechless. Through all the awfulness, the sarcasm and the meanness, she seemed to believe that things had been going well.

**Update 1:** Thank you guys so much for your kind comments and reddit gold. I really did not expect this response. I have about a half dozen completely outlined ideas for books, but the one chronicling my dating and relationship misadventures just shot to the top my priorities. Rilke said that loving another person is the most challenging thing any person will ever do, and I totally agree. But before you even get to that you have to meet them, which can be almost as difficult, as proven by this thread.

**Update 2:** Because I'm sure you're all wondering, here is the stillborn joke I told the second girl:  
  
When she asked if I had any siblings, I said:  
""Well, I have a younger brother...""  
(she feigns interest)  
""...he was stillborn...""  
(a flash of sympathy)  
""...but my parents decided to keep him...""  
(sympathy turns to fury)  
""...people ask me if it was strange growing up with a sibling who was.. dead...""  
(she's shaking her head now)  
""...it wasn't that strange. My parents taught me to treat him like any other baby...""  
(she looks around for the bartender)  
""...and we did! We'd take him to the park, push him on the swing, toss him down the slide.. I mean it's not like he ever cried...""  
(her eyes narrow)  
""...but I give my parents a lot of credit. They decided no matter what, they were going to raise him right...""  
(she stares at me blankly)  
""...and they did: as a stillborn-again Christian."" 

**Update 3:** I've been asked by several folks for more of my writing. I do have something on the subject that's a few years old, and it might be my best worst date of all. I've posted it over at /r/datinghell because it wouldn't fit in the comments. Enjoy?

Got to a muddy off-camber section not yet 3 minutes in, already passing like mad. My competitor squeaked by a 50+ rider, I attempted to do the same (calling out respectfully)...nope, cut off and bumped into a wire fence. Alright buddy. ""Comin' right instead!"" Move past, he takes no heed of my warning and swerves right into me, taking us both out. My competitor (eventual winner) turned into a distant speck. I yelled at the guy for messing with the front of the race. His response? ""Don't take it so seriously."" 

Finished the race mainly bothered by the swelling in my face from his tire, noticed at one point my leg was bleeding but paid no attention. 40 minutes later I finished 3rd (dammit) and was advised to go the med tent...lady's eyes got real big. Scrubbed the shit out of that thing....didn't hurt until the adrenaline wore down. Cue visit to the ER, 22 stitches, awkward bandaging for a couple weeks, ruined season.

Damn old people.

I'm most in-line politically with QS, but I find Francoise Davide hopelessly naive and have so far been unimpressed with Amir Khadir.

314,"The following answer is based upon information in *Downfall*, by Richard Frank and *Racing the Enemy* by Tsuyoshi Hasegawa. These are two of the best books on the final days of the Pacific side of World War II.

***

In Japan, there was never a thought of surrendering before Germany. In 1944, the German military attache in Tokyo reported that the entire country was mobilizing as the tide of war turned against it. He reported the determination of the ""Japanese Army and the circles it influences to go through with the war without compromise on the side of Germany.""

The Portuguese minister to Japan reported in May 1944 that ""the fortification of coasts and mountains continues, giving the impression that this country, like Germany, is disposed to prosecute the war to its very end without the least probability of victory.""

In June 1944, Swiss minister Camille Gorge observed, ""Japan does not expect to win, but is still hoping to escape by prolonging the war long enough to exhaust [her] enemies.""

As Frank concludes: ""... no matter how desperate the situation, Japan intended to fight to the bitter end."" This was apparent as early as spring 1944, before the beginning of the strategic bombing campaign.

By 1945, it was clear that things were nearing an end. Japanese minister to Switzerland Shunichi Kase reported in April to Tokyo that he had ""rather concrete knowledge"" of a plan for Hitler (or other top Nazi leaders) to escape Germany to Japan on a long-range aircraft. On April 12, the Japanese military and naval attaches in Germany asked for a long-range aircraft that could fly from Norway to Japanese territory (likely over the pole to Manchuria, overflying the Soviet Union). The plane was to carry a German assistant air attache and one other passenger. The flight did not take place.

Kase later pushed for peace from his post in Bonn, saying that he had interviewed three Swiss banking officials who said ""Japan is not an object of world-wide detestation like Nazi Germany,"" and therefore should make a peace offer.

In late April, Tokyo radioed its officials in Europe, asking them to report ""as fully as possible"" on the last stage of resistance in Germany ""in order to furnish reference material for the Decisive Battle."" This was a reference to the expected invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The attache in Lisbon was told to pay particular attention to the training of civilian militias and what effect the direct participation of the German High Command and Hitler in combat had on civilian morale.

Magic intercepts in spring 1945 revealed instructions from the Japanese foreign ministry to its diplomats in Moscow. They needed to know what Soviet intentions would be following the surrender of Germany. The cancellation of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact on April 5 was seen as a sign that the Soviet Union would enter the war sooner, rather than later. Secretly, Stalin had promised Churchill and Roosevelt that he would enter the Pacific war within three months of the German surrender.

On April 30, the Supreme War Leadership Council met and decided ""to continue the war until the objective of the Greater East Asia War is achieved. To that end, Japanese diplomats were given instructions to try to feel out Soviet officials and see what the price would be to prevent the Soviet Union from entering the war. Barring that, they were to discern when and if the Soviet Union would enter the war. 

Not until August 2 did these instructions shift, and diplomats began tentative feelers to see under what circumstances the Allies would end the war.

Publicly, Japanese officials announced their intentions to fight on to the conclusion of the war. Kantarō Suzuki, the Prime Minister of Japan, declared in a radio announcement on May 3 (the day after Hitler's suicide) that the Japanese people should continue fighting with the spirit of a kamikaze pilot.

Shigenori Tōgō, Japan's minister of foreign affairs, stated: ""German actions [will] not affect the Empire's determination to pursue the war against the United States and Britain.""

On May 9, the day after Germany surrendered, the Japanese government declared that its objective the war was self-preservation and self-defense, so therefore Japan should be even more determined to defend itself against the United States and Britain, regardless of the situation in Europe.

318,"""**Facetime**"" is just a new name for video calling which has been part of even old Nokia's. Heck every phone I had 6-8 years had that feature. 


**Siri** which is considered one of their best piece of innovation has been a part of Android for years. The difference was the Siri talked back making you feel important while Android's voice search could do everything the first Siri could without talking back at you like an annoying GPS robot which we are already sick of already. By the time Siri started doing useful stuff Android's voice search had already been improved even more and I still find it more useful than Siri as it has better engines and apps supporting it which are easier, more productive and refined unlike Apple's apps which I got sick off in a day.


Nearly every single feature they pick up from ancient devices or even those currently in the market and they call it iCum etcetera to sell it. Yes it sells and thats their achievement but it really bothers me that these fan boys then have the nerve to call out other companies with better products and more innovation out by ""rytin lyk dis"".
I predict **Iphone5** or whatever it will be called will have something along the line of ""iDisplay"" letting you to some extent change the display of your phone which you can do in nearly every even ancient phone. How Apple ""just works"" I'll never know. thats like saying Windows 98 ""just worked"". The stupid phone does not even give a crash report when an app stops working and instead hides it like I never opened the app in the first place. Android is honest and lets you know the app has a problem so you can message the developer or just close it or even wait.

I had an iPhone 4s and a 3gs. I've also had the lowest end HTC and currently one of the best Android's in the market. The fact of the matter is that my cheap ass HTC running on android 2.3.5 did so much more than what you can ever do in the iPhone. It was also faster, more customizable and everything took less steps to do which is 100% opposite to what Apple fans say that ""it just works"". 

You think the iPhone ""just works""? Watch this 5 part video series if you've never had an Android and if you will still believe an apple ""it just works"".

Adherence to the free market, after all, is now not uncommon among economists (albeit not with Mises' unerring consistency), but few are ready to adopt the characteristically Austrian method which Mises systematized and named ""praxeology.""

I could not agree more with that. I spent my initial years with Austrian Economics thinking that mainstream economists hate Austrian economics for its libertarian leanings, but that's not true, the conclusions of Austrian Economics are quite acceptable to many people(as long as you don't say they are coming from Austrian Economics), its the Austrian Methodology which everybody in Economics profession hate.

Calling it homeopathy of real economics is much more easy than actually making a point against it. My graft with mainstream economics(and I would sincerely be excited about something like that) if it considered time preference or time as a factor, if everything is seen from a lens of single timeframe that's what really turns me off about mainstream economics. This is why the supposed pro-free market school ""Chicago school"" is as annoying to me as Keynesian school of economics. And inconsistency is another point against them(this is something where Maxian ideology scores higher than Keynesian/neo-classical economics).

But of course lugkuv65v4u65 you don't have to reply to any of the real criticisms you can just go back to making jabs about how Austrian Economics has no more consideration than [Phlogiston Theory of Fire](http://www.slate.com/id/9593/) or how is it the homeopathy of real economics.

You do realize that for a non-decided observer comments like ""homeopathy of real economics"" against constant attempts to hold a valid conversation sounds like that the former person just doesn't know his shit. You would be much more effective if you could think of a valid criticism and stick to it than saying things like ""Austrian Economics is the homeopathy of **real** economics"".",13,2437,376,400,74,2061,0,4,1975,462,74,173,0,157,0.06963027282794725,Pretty positive,Positive,0.46943018222087995,Objective/subjective,Objective/subjective,0.9244444444444444,Pretty good,Good

337,"I was a kid when this happened... My uncle and I were finishing up chopping/gathering firewood for my grandmother because it was getting dark. Driving back on a dirt road at about 30mph (give or take 5mph) I had this awful sense of being watched. Before I could turn to look out my window (passenger side) my uncle quickly shouted, ""Don't!"" I completely froze. My heart felt like it was beating out of my chest then completely stopped when I heard a *tap tap* on my window. My uncle sped up and was loudly praying in my native language. I didn't know what was going on and thought it was over till our truck suddenly dipped from the bed. My uncle then started saying, ""Look at me"" and ""Don't turn away"" over and over. Then I heard it again, *tap tap* but from the window behind me. It was getting harder for me to breathe and I wanted to cry. A minute or two passed and the truck dipped again. My uncle looked around and sighed. It was quiet besides the truck and the road. He looked at me and said, ""We will ask your father to do a prayer in the morning. So the evil will forget our faces."" (Navajo to English equivalent). I remember curling up on the seat and just staring at the radio watching the time. Listening to my uncle sing an old prayer till we got to my grandmother's house.

6,"Well, I'm going to do the downer thing.

When I was in 7th grade, I decided to play football. Just because I didn't have much else to do other than sit my ass on my computer all day and I have always liked it (For you Brits here, I will say this once, and only once. Football=Egghand) so I figured wtf, why not. Fast forward to my Freshman year in Highschool. I fail algebra. Whooptidoo. To continue football, I have to pass, so I take it in summer school. When I am there, I meet this amazing girl, beautiful, and smart. She took the quote ""I never let schooling interfere with my education"" to heart. So were in the class, we talk a little, nothing major. So on the last night of summer school, the football team throws a party (nothing like having most of the team in summer school) and I bring her along. We're there, having a good time, and someone busts out some beer. Party time. We drink. We make out. We pass out. The next morning, her parents are at my door, and my parents are calling my cell phone freaking the hell out to find out where she is. How my school district did summer school, was they pooled all of the students and drifted them around round-robin to the 7 high schools in the district, and this summer it was my high school's time. I had no clue if I was going to see her again, because she was in the band and theatre, and was thinking about killing off band to focus on theatre. She told me before she met up with her parents she was going to stay in band to try to see me again (made me feel awesome!), as long as I played football. We stayed in touch over email and whatnot, and I saw her when we went to play at her school, etc. This went on for sophmore year. I considered us dating at this time, as did she. Usual fun stuff happened over summer. Hang out, drink, but no sex at this point. My junior year I got injured in Football. Bad. I was a center, so I got beat down alot in the games. During one of the games, I got in my usual stance, and the QB decided to run behind me but slipped in the mud. His helmet went into the back of my knee, causing my foot to stay where it was, and my body to fall back. It tore my knee up. She took a week off of school to be by my side at the hospital.


It was during this week of hospitalization that I thought I want to stay with her for as long as possible. I had 3 months of bi-weekly physical therapy (not needed medically, but to have a chance at playing again) she was there. She ended up dropping band because of this. All it did was reinforce this fact that I wanted to stay with her. End of my Junior year, she decides to go visit her father is Moscow. She was born in Russia, but moved here when she was 3 months old, so she had a Russian passport, etc. She was going to be there for the entire summer, which was fine with me. Gave me time to dick around on my computer. Before she leaves, I decide I might as well make the foolish choice to propose. She said yes, all that good stuff, blah blah blah sappy story about how amazing it was to hear her say yes, blah blah blah. So she goes for the summer.

August rolls around, and its time for her to come back, I know shes on the plane, and about the time she should be back. Memphis Intl has horrible cell reception, so I assume she is still working around customs there. I get a call from a blocked number. Knowing she is supposed to call me, I answer. Its her. Shes crying. I can't make out what she is saying for quite some time, but I distinctly make out ""denied entry"". It finally clicks- shes been denied reentry into the United States. I can't fathom why she was, but she has been denied reentry and is being forced to return to Moscow following an appeal process than can take months. After talking her through it, she gets cleared to stay in a hotel for the night, and take the first flight back in the morning.

So she is back in Russia, and all we can do is talk every chance we get. Im going apeshit in school at this point, preparing for a midterm exam that is going to kick my Senior ass. So one night, shes on the phone with me, and then she suddenly stops talking. Stops responding. Stops being herself. I call her dad, who rushes home to find her passed out on the floor. She gets taken to a hospital over there, and I am going nuts worried about her. After a couple of days, it turns out she has a tumor on her brain that is putting pressure on her skull/brain. They take a biopsy, and wait for the results. Malignant. My world is shattered, and I can't even begin to think about how her parents are thinking. At this point, her mother pawns a bunch of stuff and flys out there. I don't know what to think, and sure enough, they operate. First one is fine, goes well, but it was just an exploratory/preventative surgery- designed to stop the growth, but won't help at all. They get the information to get the tumor out, but its deep in her brain. She won't be the same person, and possibly even motor functions. She decides to go on. I talk to her before the surgery. She is scared, and is worried about how I am feeling.

She comes out of the second surgery fine. She can walk and talk just fine, but she has some issues with memories of middle to high school. She doesn't remember me. She knows that I am important- she has a ton of pictures to show her that. So we are talking on the phone, and she knows my voice, knows it to the point it comforts her, but doesn't know where she knows it from, or why she feels this way. They run some tests- they need to do another surgery.

They start to do this one. She starts out fine, and then....they lose her. They noticed that her vitals were starting to fade, and they immediately began to attempt to save her life. Long story short- they don't. I get a call in class from her mom. She dies on the table. Her will stated that she wanted to be buried in Moscow, so they plan on having the funeral when I can attend (that weekend), but in a bitch move decide to have it during the week when I can't attend. They also decide to forgo the traditional 3rd, 9th, and 40th day services. So basically I got shafted out of the memorial service for my fiancee. I'm devastated, as you can guess. I decide to not deal with her mom anymore. It affects my school to the point where I can't graduate if I did everything to pass, so I drop out. I get my GED, and have been in between jobs ever since.


Thats really the best thing I can say about my life. Nothing else of note. I sit around and dick around with my computer. But everyone has that one defining event in thier life. This was basically what caused me to be me.

I was asked if I would change anything. Nope. To change one thing, changes me. And even with that- I love myself.

Being a budding homosexual myself I decided to venture into a few of the different places to just see and experience the different areas. I went to the Starbucks, the Priape (Sex store) and the other sex shops as well.

I went into this one, which name I cannot remember, and descending the stairs. I went in and looked around and then noticed a door on the back saying you needed tokens.

30,"Much like a computer can have a nonbiological virus so can a brain.  A virus that can be removed easily or fails to spread dies out and another virus (religion) replaces it. 

It isn't enough to do good to go to heaven, it is a requirement by the virus that you have the correct version of the virus running and you accept it and only it.

Much like a parasite often alters the behavior of the host, as does a religion when people become hostile at just the thought that the virus/religion/parasite may be the wrong one.

When one religious group tries by force to remove the other religion  the people will fight to the death protecting their version of the religion, sometimes even if the strain is only slightly different.

It is through understanding this behavior that Christianity was able to succeed with the Jews.

Matthew 5:17  ""Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill"" 

The reason for this passage wasn't because the Jesus actually supported the old testament but because people are unwilling to replace their religion, but tell them their religion is true and you can prove it, but you have a few more rules to add and suddenly you have replaced their version of the religion in the only way possible.

The virus doesn't take with a small amount of people, these people tend to question everything by nature and prefer evidence for claims. These people are a glitch in the system called Atheists and often go into technical and scientific fields because if their nature.

Life is short and people are afraid of death, people want nothing more than to believe with every fiber of their being that it isn't really over when their time is up so they don't like ""atheists"" trying to get them out of their comfort zone and questioning religion. It is THE most uncomfortable subject for them ever. They'll kill and even risk their lives to protect this utopian view of life after death so it is nothing to shave a few people out of their social circle they once called ""friend"".

In this information age the role of traditional religions will be challenged by knowledge but it is probably true that most people have a ""god sized hole"" in their hearts because if for no other reason they are secretly terrified of death.

55,"So this is another question that doesn't really have a single answer. Generally people have good playback quality (otherwise they wouldn't use youtube, right?). Video decoding - especially h.264 - is a very CPU intensive operation.

CPU performance is a hard thing to measure reliably. Flash Player doesn't have anything built in that tells you, so if you want to approximate you have to run some custom CPU test like run an operation over and over and measure the time it takes. Unfortunately there's no way to know if the user has a bunch of other apps running at the time, and of course these things can change with no notice at all (a user might be encoding a video one day and not doing anything else the next so you get wildly different results).

There are many things that contribute to playback stuttering. Since you specifically said ""regardless of buffer"" I'm assuming that you are talking about actual decoding + displaying of the video (you never see the loading spinner appear, the video is just choppy or low fps).

Some things you can do to get better playback performance:

1) Make sure you have the very latest Flash Player. 10.0.45.2 is the current version from adobe. Upgrading from Flash player 9 to 10+ will give you a pretty decent improvement, and adobe is always working on improving video quality (despite all the hate they've made really good progress lately).

2) Don't have a bunch of browser tabs open. We've found that having a few tabs open with misc. websites can affect playback. This means the browser has less CPU cycles to decode your video and it could stutter. Also take a look at what other things you have running on your computer. Also check your task manager and see if there's something in there taking up more CPU than it should.

3) Watch a smaller sized version of the video. Are you trying to watch 1080p on a laptop that has a small screen? Try dropping down to 720p or 360p. Does that help? (also see #5)

4) Watch the video in fullscreen. Especially the HD sizes will perform much better when they are in fullscreen because we can take advantage of Flash Player's hardware scaling + hardware acceleration (on some platforms).

5) Watch a video size appropriate for the size of the video player and/or your screen. I often see people selecting an HD sized video but leaving the player at the 360 size (that's the small size on youtube.com). This is just silly. You are downloading this *giant* video and then making your computer scale it down to display it at 360p. It not only wastes your bandwidth, but wastes your  CPU cycles since the player has to decode the giant video frames and then ends up throwing out most of the data anyway. Also don't watch a video size that's bigger than your screen. If your laptop is has a 1024x768 screen, that's not even big enough to show 720p widescreen video at it's native size. The player will have to scale it down to fit (720p video is generally 1280x720px) You'd be better off watching the 480p size and you likely wont notice much quality difference. In your account preferences, there's an option to ""always play the lower quality videos."" This might be a good option if your computer is slow.

2. Wait. Wait until you find ""The One"", no not the jewelry shop but the girl of your dreams (trust me, she'll come around).

3. Once you've dated said girl for the appropriate amount of time and would like to ""put a ring on it"" just give her the old ring... No stupid I'm not serious, that'd be preposterous and mean.

4. Figured out what the girl wants for a ring and go to a jewelry store. Now I'm not in the jewelry business, but from what I understand is many of the ""Name Brand"" jewelers have ridiculous mark up. So instead find a local owned jewelry store or five.

5. Shop around, I know you probably know this but it's worth mentioning. Once you've found the perfect ring at a reasonable price go into the store and see if you can trade in the ring toward the price of the new one. If the ex-ring has good diamonds sometimes the jeweler can use the old diamonds and therefore cutting some of that cost. Also they can melt the gold down and ""buy"" it from you toward the cost 

6. Profit. Maybe, this method takes a little bit of involvement and haggling. I shopped around local jewelry stores until I found one that was honest and willing to put the cost of the old ring toward the new one. 

Anywho, dunno why I felt like I need to share that. If it's not clear let me know.
