Please don't accuse me of me being ignorant or biased of the facts. I've looked into the other side of the argument and was not convinced by either of the two studies GMO opponents like to cite; the french Seralini study was debunked and the american Huber study turned out to have been bunk as well.

27397,Emily.,Greg.,Jamal.,Lakisha.,720.0,"Well, I'm going to do the downer thing.

When I was in 7th grade, I decided to play football. Just because I didn't have much else to do other than sit my ass on my computer all day and I have always liked it (For you Brits here, I will say this once, and only once. Football=Egghand) so I figured wtf, why not. Fast forward to my Freshman year in Highschool. I fail algebra. Whooptidoo. To continue football, I have to pass, so I take it in summer school. When I am there, I meet this amazing girl, beautiful, and smart. She took the quote ""I never let schooling interfere with my education"" to heart. So were in the class, we talk a little, nothing major. So on the last night of summer school, the football team throws a party (nothing like having most of the team in summer school) and I bring her along. We're there, having a good time, and someone busts out some beer. Party time. We drink. We make out. We pass out. The next morning, her parents are at my door, and my parents are calling my cell phone freaking the hell out to find out where she is. How my school district did summer school, was they pooled all of the students and drifted them around round-robin to the 7 high schools in the district, and this summer it was my high school's time. I had no clue if I was going to see her again, because she was in the band and theatre, and was thinking about killing off band to focus on theatre. She told me before she met up with her parents she was going to stay in band to try to see me again (made me feel awesome!), as long as I played football. We stayed in touch over email and whatnot, and I saw her when we went to play at her school, etc. This went on for sophmore year. I considered us dating at this time, as did she. Usual fun stuff happened over summer. Hang out, drink, but no sex at this point. My junior year I got injured in Football. Bad. I was a center, so I got beat down alot in the games. During one of the games, I got in my usual stance, and the QB decided to run behind me but slipped in the mud. His helmet went into the back of my knee, causing my foot to stay where it was, and my body to fall back. It tore my knee up. She took a week off of school to be by my side at the hospital.


It was during this week of hospitalization that I thought I want to stay with her for as long as possible. I had 3 months of bi-weekly physical therapy (not needed medically, but to have a chance at playing again) she was there. She ended up dropping band because of this. All it did was reinforce this fact that I wanted to stay with her. End of my Junior year, she decides to go visit her father is Moscow. She was born in Russia, but moved here when she was 3 months old, so she had a Russian passport, etc. She was going to be there for the entire summer, which was fine with me. Gave me time to dick around on my computer. Before she leaves, I decide I might as well make the foolish choice to propose. She said yes, all that good stuff, blah blah blah sappy story about how amazing it was to hear her say yes, blah blah blah. So she goes for the summer.

August rolls around, and its time for her to come back, I know shes on the plane, and about the time she should be back. Memphis Intl has horrible cell reception, so I assume she is still working around customs there. I get a call from a blocked number. Knowing she is supposed to call me, I answer. Its her. Shes crying. I can't make out what she is saying for quite some time, but I distinctly make out ""denied entry"". It finally clicks- shes been denied reentry into the United States. I can't fathom why she was, but she has been denied reentry and is being forced to return to Moscow following an appeal process than can take months. After talking her through it, she gets cleared to stay in a hotel for the night, and take the first flight back in the morning.

So she is back in Russia, and all we can do is talk every chance we get. Im going apeshit in school at this point, preparing for a midterm exam that is going to kick my Senior ass. So one night, shes on the phone with me, and then she suddenly stops talking. Stops responding. Stops being herself. I call her dad, who rushes home to find her passed out on the floor. She gets taken to a hospital over there, and I am going nuts worried about her. After a couple of days, it turns out she has a tumor on her brain that is putting pressure on her skull/brain. They take a biopsy, and wait for the results. Malignant. My world is shattered, and I can't even begin to think about how her parents are thinking. At this point, her mother pawns a bunch of stuff and flys out there. I don't know what to think, and sure enough, they operate. First one is fine, goes well, but it was just an exploratory/preventative surgery- designed to stop the growth, but won't help at all. They get the information to get the tumor out, but its deep in her brain. She won't be the same person, and possibly even motor functions. She decides to go on. I talk to her before the surgery. She is scared, and is worried about how I am feeling.

She comes out of the second surgery fine. She can walk and talk just fine, but she has some issues with memories of middle to high school. She doesn't remember me. She knows that I am important- she has a ton of pictures to show her that. So we are talking on the phone, and she knows my voice, knows it to the point it comforts her, but doesn't know where she knows it from, or why she feels this way. They run some tests- they need to do another surgery.

They start to do this one. She starts out fine, and then....they lose her. They noticed that her vitals were starting to fade, and they immediately began to attempt to save her life. Long story short- they don't. I get a call in class from her mom. She dies on the table. Her will stated that she wanted to be buried in Moscow, so they plan on having the funeral when I can attend (that weekend), but in a bitch move decide to have it during the week when I can't attend. They also decide to forgo the traditional 3rd, 9th, and 40th day services. So basically I got shafted out of the memorial service for my fiancee. I'm devastated, as you can guess. I decide to not deal with her mom anymore. It affects my school to the point where I can't graduate if I did everything to pass, so I drop out. I get my GED, and have been in between jobs ever since.


Thats really the best thing I can say about my life. Nothing else of note. I sit around and dick around with my computer. But everyone has that one defining event in thier life. This was basically what caused me to be me.

I was asked if I would change anything. Nope. To change one thing, changes me. And even with that- I love myself.

I went into this one, which name I cannot remember, and descending the stairs. I went in and looked around and then noticed a door on the back saying you needed tokens. So, I went to the counter and gave the guy a couple of bucks and went into the back with my tokens. I found a booth that worked, and didn't notice the hole next to the seat. I put the quarter in and saw the older 80s/90s gay porn stuff. Really 'vintage' looking and quite boring. 

Then I hear a whistle. I look down and this tongue was flicking in and out of the hole. I said ""Nooo..."" in a long drawn out way and he backed up. I heard a zip come undone and he stuck his dick, and balls, through the hole. I didn't know how to react.

A virus that can be removed easily or fails to spread dies out and another virus (religion) replaces it. 

It isn't enough to do good to go to heaven, it is a requirement by the virus that you have the correct version of the virus running and you accept it and only it.

Much like a parasite often alters the behavior of the host, as does a religion when people become hostile at just the thought that the virus/religion/parasite may be the wrong one.

When one religious group tries by force to remove the other religion  the people will fight to the death protecting their version of the religion, sometimes even if the strain is only slightly different.

It is through understanding this behavior that Christianity was able to succeed with the Jews.

Matthew 5:17  ""Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill"" 

The reason for this passage wasn't because the Jesus actually supported the old testament but because people are unwilling to replace their religion, but tell them their religion is true and you can prove it, but you have a few more rules to add and suddenly you have replaced their version of the religion in the only way possible.

The virus doesn't take with a small amount of people, these people tend to question everything by nature and prefer evidence for claims. These people are a glitch in the system called Atheists and often go into technical and scientific fields because if their nature.

Life is short and people are afraid of death, people want nothing more than to believe with every fiber of their being that it isn't really over when their time is up so they don't like ""atheists"" trying to get them out of their comfort zone and questioning religion. It is THE most uncomfortable subject for them ever. They'll kill and even risk their lives to protect this utopian view of life after death so it is nothing to shave a few people out of their social circle they once called ""friend"".

In this information age the role of traditional religions will be challenged by knowledge but it is probably true that most people have a ""god sized hole"" in their hearts because if for no other reason they are secretly terrified of death.

To drjalexanderphysics's friend  (just noticed physics in the name) his friend's decision represents more than just a lack of acceptance for drjalexanderphysics's lack of religion. drjalexanderphysics represents his absolute worst fear and something he at some level already knows but chooses not to accept: That some day he is really going to die."

- Loved Entreri / Jarlaxle. 
- Drizzt as a ""chosen"" of Lolth... genius. Made me go ""oh hell no"" then immediately ""oh hell yes"". Very well throught out/ written plot development!


Questions you might get every day but well, when will I get a chance to ask them again? Forgive me in advance, but:

- Plans for the post-""leap ahead"" novels? Any concrete ideas?

As for Amalur:

- How deep do you intend to explore and novelize this world?

And finally:

- With LOTR such a success, Game of Thrones a major HBO hit and The Hobbit coming up, how are we on an RA Salvatore penned screenplay?

Generally people have good playback quality (otherwise they wouldn't use youtube, right?). Video decoding - especially h.264 - is a very CPU intensive operation.

CPU performance is a hard thing to measure reliably. Flash Player doesn't have anything built in that tells you, so if you want to approximate you have to run some custom CPU test like run an operation over and over and measure the time it takes. Unfortunately there's no way to know if the user has a bunch of other apps running at the time, and of course these things can change with no notice at all (a user might be encoding a video one day and not doing anything else the next so you get wildly different results).

There are many things that contribute to playback stuttering. Since you specifically said ""regardless of buffer"" I'm assuming that you are talking about actual decoding + displaying of the video (you never see the loading spinner appear, the video is just choppy or low fps).

Some things you can do to get better playback performance:

1) Make sure you have the very latest Flash Player. 10.0.45.2 is the current version from adobe. Upgrading from Flash player 9 to 10+ will give you a pretty decent improvement, and adobe is always working on improving video quality (despite all the hate they've made really good progress lately).

2) Don't have a bunch of browser tabs open. We've found that having a few tabs open with misc. websites can affect playback. This means the browser has less CPU cycles to decode your video and it could stutter. Also take a look at what other things you have running on your computer. Also check your task manager and see if there's something in there taking up more CPU than it should.

3) Watch a smaller sized version of the video. Are you trying to watch 1080p on a laptop that has a small screen? Try dropping down to 720p or 360p. Does that help? (also see #5)

4) Watch the video in fullscreen. Especially the HD sizes will perform much better when they are in fullscreen because we can take advantage of Flash Player's hardware scaling + hardware acceleration (on some platforms).

5) Watch a video size appropriate for the size of the video player and/or your screen. I often see people selecting an HD sized video but leaving the player at the 360 size (that's the small size on youtube.com). This is just silly. You are downloading this *giant* video and then making your computer scale it down to display it at 360p. It not only wastes your bandwidth, but wastes your  CPU cycles since the player has to decode the giant video frames and then ends up throwing out most of the data anyway. Also don't watch a video size that's bigger than your screen. If your laptop is has a 1024x768 screen, that's not even big enough to show 720p widescreen video at it's native size. The player will have to scale it down to fit (720p video is generally 1280x720px) You'd be better off watching the 480p size and you likely wont notice much quality difference. In your account preferences, there's an option to ""always play the lower quality videos."" This might be a good option if your computer is slow.

13740,,,,,100.0,"First off, apologizes on the unfortunate (or fortunate?) circumstance, I've been there and it sucked but for a moment (now happily married to non-crazy chick). 

Second, I originally spent $2,000 on the ex-engagement ring, not to mention the band which was another $500 or so. Now I realize it's to late but I figured if anyone else finds themselves in this situation I have some advice on how to get the most out of the sell:

1. Save the ring. Don't pawn it off or sell it to the first jewelry shop you enter. However if it hurts like hell knowing the damned thing still exists like the ""One Ring"" than go throw it into the fires of ""Mor-First-Jewlery-Shop-You-Come-Across-dor"".

2. Wait. Wait until you find ""The One"", no not the jewelry shop but the girl of your dreams (trust me, she'll come around).

3. Once you've dated said girl for the appropriate amount of time and would like to ""put a ring on it"" just give her the old ring... No stupid I'm not serious, that'd be preposterous and mean.

4. Figured out what the girl wants for a ring and go to a jewelry store. Now I'm not in the jewelry business, but from what I understand is many of the ""Name Brand"" jewelers have ridiculous mark up. So instead find a local owned jewelry store or five.

5. Shop around, I know you probably know this but it's worth mentioning. Once you've found the perfect ring at a reasonable price go into the store and see if you can trade in the ring toward the price of the new one. If the ex-ring has good diamonds sometimes the jeweler can use the old diamonds and therefore cutting some of that cost. Also they can melt the gold down and ""buy"" it from you toward the cost 

6. Profit. Maybe, this method takes a little bit of involvement and haggling. I shopped around local jewelry stores until I found one that was honest and willing to put the cost of the old ring toward the new one. 

Anywho, dunno why I felt like I need to share that. If it's not clear let me know.

&gt;Right now, American manufacturing is struggling to fill 200,000 vacant positions. **There are 450,000 openings in trades, transportation and utilities. The skills gap is real, and it’s getting wider. In Alabama, a third of all skilled tradesmen are over 55. They’re retiring fast, and no one is there to replace them.**

&gt;Alabama’s not alone. A few months ago in Atlanta I ran into Tom Vilsack, our Secretary of Agriculture. Tom told me about a governor who was unable to move forward on the construction of a power plant. The reason was telling. It wasn’t a lack of funds. It wasn’t a lack of support. It was a lack of qualified welders.

&gt;In general, we’re surprised that high unemployment can exist at the same time as a skilled labor shortage. We shouldn’t be. We’ve pretty much guaranteed it.

&gt;In high schools, the vocational arts have all but vanished. We’ve elevated the importance of “higher education” to such a lofty perch that all other forms of knowledge are now labeled “alternative.” Millions of parents and kids see apprenticeships and on-the-job-training opportunities as “vocational consolation prizes,” best suited for those not cut out for a four-year degree. And still, we talk about millions of “shovel ready” jobs for a society that doesn’t encourage people to pick up a shovel.

&gt;In a hundred different ways, we have slowly marginalized an entire category of critical professions, reshaping our expectations of a “good job” into something that no longer looks like work. A few years from now, an hour with a good plumber â€“ if you can find one â€“ is going to cost more than an hour with a good psychiatrist. At which point we’ll all be in need of both.

&gt;I came here today because guys like my grandfather are no less important to civilized life than they were 50 years ago. Maybe they’re in short supply because we don’t acknowledge them they way we used to. We leave our check on the kitchen counter, and hope the work gets done. That needs to change.



What people don't seem to understand is:

1&gt; College is overrated, not worthless and people should stop confusing the two terms. Arguing that college isn't worthless fails to make an argument about cost and benefit.

2&gt; You can't make everyone go to school. If at 18 someone doesn't want to do well at college, they won't. This idea that everyone can benefit from ""expanding their horizons"" is bullshit. You can lead a horse to water...
And if that horse won't drink, then you should find something useful, prideful, and self-supporting for them to do."

I'm not voting your post up or down because I don't know anything about your situation.  Some questions that should factor into this decision:

1. Has your father previously demonstrated homophobia?  How much?  (Inappropriate jokes?  Statements that homosexual activity is sinful?  Violent comments against gay marriage?)
2.  Are you a legal minor?  Is he your legal guardian?  (If yes to both, he might be able to force you into ""treatment"".)
3.  Whether or not you are a minor, do you rely on your father for housing, food, tuition, or financial support of any kind?  Would you be able to get by if he cut any or all of that off?

If he does have legal or financial control over you right now, and he has expressed extreme or violent anti-gay sentiments, this might not be a good time.  Wait until you're legally and financially independent.  If he shows tolerance around gay rights issues, etc. and you have a strong, open relationship in other regards, it might work.  Unless he already has figured it out (and even if he has) it still will probably be difficult for him to hear this news and work through it.  I recommend that whenever you do come out to him, have contact information for [PFLAG](http://www.pflag.org) (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and some other resources, to give to him.  (I also recommend the book *Always My Child* by Kevin Jennings.)

I am not a psychologist, therapist, licensed crisis counselor, or anything like that.  I still strongly encourage you to find someone to talk to, in person or on the phone, and to do some research online or at the library.  And find another therapist.  Not because she thinks you coming out is a bad idea - it might be, it might not - but because it doesn't sound like you feel supported by her.

Good luck to you."

Rage faces are especially terrible in general

A good chunk of the internet hates you and can hardly tell the difference between you and 9gag. The reason you don't see it is because it usually avoids this site entirely.

I'm sure most of reddit would agree but the le shit needs to stop. Once thats taken care of, move on to purging the rage novels.

There are intelligent Christians and Republicans in this world, and there is a political world beyond reddit. Republicans have some good perspectives on some things, and some Christians/Catholics/Whatever aren't all about the silly mythology and more about living your life as a good person. Reddit does NOT have all the answers, and you'd be surprised on what you'd learn from others. Open your minds.

The reddiquette is majorly ignored and the upvote downvote system is terrible for comments is fucking awful and you damn well know it. I immediately cruise down to the downvoted section because I can guarantee reading an intelligent argument (usually one poor soul is being gang banged by the hivemind) is far more interesting then ""LOL ARROW TO DA KNEE"" or ""HIVEMIND COCK SUCK COMMENT""

Verbally abusing your loving friends and family over facebook, or even the kitchen table because they said ""Thank God"" or something completely unconfrontational is possibly the worst thing I've seen come out of mankind. Especially if youre still in high school. I don't care how right you are. My father is the most brilliant man I've known and all the advice he's given me has hardly been wrong and he's a pretty hard core catholic.

Insulting 4chan or SomethingAwful or wherever by calling them ""fat losers who live in their moms basement"" does not make your site better. In fact, it makes it worse.

That was probably more opinionated then what OP wanted but oh well."

Macro - Addition of *new* genetic information in a population. Large scale changes linking one kind to another.

[Insane misogyny numero uno](http://puerarchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheFuturist_TheMisandryBubble.pdf)

&gt;The Western World has quietly become a civilization that undervalues men and overvalues women, where the state forcibly transfers resources from men to women creating various perverse incentives for otherwise good women to conduct great evil against men and children, and where male nature is vilified but female nature is celebrated. This is unfair to both genders, and is a recipe for a rapid civilizational decline and displacement, the costs of which will ultimately be borne by a subsequent generation of innocent women, rather than men, as soon as 2020.

I'm quite excited to see this apocalyptic nonsense work itself out. Funny how similar to a cult this already sounds.

&gt; The difference between men and women in maturity, however, is that while females mature earlier in life, they also stop maturing at around the age of eighteen, as Schopenhauer aptly observes. And while men don’t catch up to women’s maturity until they reach around age twenty-eight, after that the men keep maturing - often throughout their entire lives.

Women are literally children amirite? A sixty year old feeeeeeeeemale is less mature than a twenty year old man.

[This might be my favourite - a rant formatted to look like an academic paper written by F Roger Devlin, a white nationalist: nommer drie](https://dontmarry.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/sexualutopia.pdf)

This one, I couldn't even pull out a quote from. Pages 14-16 are his account of why all date rapes are not in fact rapes. It made me feel physically sick.

So in summary, the Western world is on the brink of collapse because of women, women are infantile children who are incapable of maturing past 18, and date rape is just the result of bad decisions that women should suck up and let happen to them (according to a white nationalist).

Now, this dog had either a [cut tail](http://photo.sohu.com/20040803/Img221334946.jpg) or a super tight [corkskrew tail](http://0.tqn.com/w/experts/Bulldogs-2360/2010/12/Kirbys-tail.jpg) and was the most utterly lazy dog I ever had the chance to get to know.

Being fat and lazy he spent most of the day sitting on his ass. Why he didn't lie down, I do not know. It could have something to do with his upbringing or the fact that he would roll onto his side due to the size of his belly every time he lay down.

Interestingly enough, as a result of sitting on his ass for the better part of his entire life, his tail had somewhat deformed. It was pressed flat from the pressure of the dog and at that point resembled a flap covering his asshole.

Furter more, every time he got up - the flap would lift away from his rectum and a *toot* of the most terrible nature would emerge. Something must have crawled up and died in that dog, because every fart was... Hard to describe, but the *best* description would be a symphony of horror.

When we discovered this feature, it was instantly named ""the assflap effect"". Now, you would think that we would try to leave the poor dog alone but no. In a momemt of curiosity I tried to lift the flap.

*toot*

I tried to press the flap.

*toot*

And with that the ""Assflap Effect Fart Button"" was discovered.

One day when my friend and I were out taking the dog for a walk, we met another dogowner and her small Jack Russel like dog. Now this dog was something else. While Assflap would just stand around looking confused the Jack Russel would jump around, tease Assflap and run away. Of course our dog were to lazy to play.

Suddenly the Jack Russel mounted the far bigger dog from behind and starting to hump. Naturally the smaller dog didn't reach up to do anything and his owner tried to assure my friend that ""It's about dominanse, it's nothing sexual"".

""I don't care, if he keeps it up, he's gonna hit the button.""

""The button?.. I thought you said it wasn't a bitch?""

""No, the fart button. With his chest.""

If you need to be full time, I'd recommend picking 3 classes in your major (or that are otherwise required) and 1 humanity/elective to get yourself up to 12 hours. If you're just trying to relax, though, then just take whatever you feel like. 6 hours will feel pretty light compared to a normal Fall or Spring semester."

I think the other thing that prevents adoption is that there aren't many published workflows that work well.  We went through quite a bit of trial and error to come up with a workflow that worked, and it didn't work well enough that I'll post it here.  I've seen others since then, but how would a newbie happen across a post on Hacker News that had that information?  

Anyone who wants to promote Git should be working on fixing the documentation and adding some basic workflows that work well to the site.  Explain what situation each workflow does well in.

We need one world class experienced leader (Godin) and, because of van Gaal's fetish with playing opposite footed CBs, we need one LCB, too (Laporte). Blackett should be no where near our first team. Him being Rojo's primary back-up next season would be an astronomical farce.

&gt; As for midfield again we only need one marquee signing. Hererra is already having a tough time getting games and unless he leave I can't imagine bringing in two midfielders this summer.

We may only need 1 ""marquee"" CM, but, in my opinion, we clearly need another good squad player if we're going to play 3CMs regularly, because Fellaini is simply not good enough to play CM for us. I want him sold ASAP.

&gt; As for wingers we really only need one additional winger, or we risk stunting Januzaj development even more than we are doing now. Valencia and young are great cover at both wing and wing back.

Young is just about adequate, but Valencia would be basically hopleless as a RW in a 4-3-3. I'd be happy to get 5mil for him in the summer."

17 Consider just one example of the good that can come when a family loyally

upholds Jehovah’s decree not to associate with disfellowshipped relatives. A

young man had been disfellowshipped for over ten years, during which time his

father, mother, and four brothers “quit mixing in company” with him. At times,

he tried to involve himself in their activities, but to their credit, each member

of the family was steadfast in not having any contact with him. After he

was reinstated, he said that he always missed the association with his family,

especially at night when he was alone. But, he admitted, had the family associated

with him even a little, that small dose would have satisfied him. However,

because he did not receive even the slightest communication from any

of his family, the burning desire to be with them became one motivating factor

in his restoring his relationship with Jehovah. Think of that if you are ever

tempted to violate God’s command not to associate with your disfellowshipped

relatives."

However drag is very much over-the-top and larger-than-life, outlandish makeup, crazy outfits (pink beards). Cross dressing can be anything from wearing xgender's clothing while not reflecting any change in personality all the way to assuming the role of the other gender (temporarily, or else you're getting into transgender). So you can think of cross dressing as putting on clothes of the opposite gender, where as drag is putting on a costume and is a real over-the-top performance, usually emphasizing comedy (sexual comedy).

Of course there are people who will disagree with what I said here, but I think it's a solid and general idea that's pretty PC.

She was blonde and petite and since I didn't know many people there I agreed. My only vehicle at the time was a motorcycle, so I left early to purchase a helmet for her so that she could ride with me. 

I arrive at her apartment, which is kind of sketchy looking. No lights on in her place or outside, and when I knock on the door an intimidatingly large guy answers it, looking sleepy and annoyed. He yells for her and she comes out to meet me. We introduce ourselves and then take my bike to a nearby sushi place. When we get off my bike she tosses me her helmet and declares ""I fucking hate motorcycles!"" She then proceeds to tell me about being drunk and falling off of one a few months earlier. 

As we're walking into the restaurant I ask a bit about where she grew up and she mentions a tiny town a couple of hours away and that ""she had to get out of there"". She then mutters something about fighting two cops and being on probation. I gently press her on the details and she explains that her parents called the cops because she was fighting with her sister and when they arrived to subdue her she ended up kicking one of them. She had been drinking Jack Daniels mixed with tequila at the time, which she claims ""tastes like candy.""

Before I go any further with this tale let me say that I love bad dates. I love the moments when disaster appears imminent and you can almost hear the clackety clack of the rollercoaster climbing the hill before gaining speed and sliding off the rails. So despite (or because) of the things she's already said, I'm having a great time.

We sit at the bar and order drinks. I order a cocktail, she orders a Patrón, neat. The bartender serves us and she downs the shot in a flash. ""Another?"" asks the bartender. ""Of course!"" she replies. When the bartender turns his back she leans over and whispers ""I'm so glad he didn't card me."" I feel a shiver of panic. ""Why?"" I ask, ""How old are you?"" 

""18,"" she answers. I am almost certain her profile said that she was 21.

The evening continues. She downs at least 4, possibly 5 shots of Patrón in less than two hours. Her mood alternates between manic and sullen. When we step outside to smoke she pulls close and kisses me. She's cute, but nuts, and drunk, and I would rather be anywhere else, and yet I'm fascinated by where this is going. Something in me senses that the best is yet to come.

I'm correct. Inside again we discuss how to spend the rest of the evening. We consider going to a nearby bar, or to the movies, but then she gets really excited about the possibility of going to a convenience store and buying some Spice. 

This is the result of a conversation in which she declares ""There's legal pot.""
""No,"" I reply, ""that isn't pot.""
""There's legal pot!"" she insists. ""There's even legal meth.""
""No. There is not legal meth.""

In any case, I'm trying to get her home safe as soon as possible so that I can meet up with my friends and tell them about this disaster of a date, so I agree to take her to a convenience store. When we get there she hops off my bike and says ""I need to piss."" I tell her that I'll take her home right after this, but she waves off that idea and disappears behind the store. The convenience store has Spice, but it does not take cards and I don't have any cash. She decides we should go to the convenience store on the next block to see if they do. 

So we walk down to the second convenience store and run into a different huge guy that she used to live with. Upon seeing him she lets out a shriek and jumps onto him with a huge hug. I am awkwardly introduced to the guy. The second convenience store does take cards, but does not have Spice. Instead I buy a flask of tequila and walk out. As she follows me out she turns to her friend and shouts ""YEAH I GOTTA GO, THIS IS MY FUCK FOR THE NIGHT!"" Then she turns to me, wide eyed, sensing, if not knowing, that a mistake had been made. The expression on her face was priceless. By this point I'm becoming annoyed. 

I drive us back to her apartment, which is still completely dark. I try to say goodnight and have a nice life, but she insists that I come in. In the journalistic interest of this story having an ending, I relent. As we walk up to the front door she realizes that she doesn't have a key and then bangs on the window until the annoyed, sleeping roommate rises (again) to let us in. She leads me into her bedroom and lights a cigarette, the first time I can remember being allowed to smoke indoors in years or since. I excuse myself to use the restroom, and once there finally realize that the reason the place is so dark is that the electricity is turned off. Like Vincent in Pulp Fiction, I stare at myself in the dim mirror and say ""You're going to go out there, say thank you, I had a lovely evening, and then you gonna leave."" It becomes apparent while washing my hands that there is also no hot water.

I enter the dark hallway and make my way back to her room. I open the door. She's lying on the bed half-naked. The bottom half. Her pants are in a pile beside the bed. ""GTFO!"" my inner Vincent pleads.

But I don't. Instead, I light a cigarette and take a sip of tequila. Then I sit on the foot of the bed and say ""So I'm going to go...""
""Just stay!"" 
""No, I really..""
""Just... hold me.""

So this is a girl who is clearly fucked up, and who just happened to meet someone who doesn't actually want anything from her and isn't interested in offering much more than a couple of drinks, conversation, and kindness. I wonder for a moment how often that happens in her life. With a sigh, I toss a blanket over her and then lie down on it and next to her. She moves restlessly and her legs are kicking of their own accord. I wonder what she's coming off of. If only we had some legal meth! After a while she mutters something I don't quite catch and falls asleep. I gather my things and creep out of the apartment. As I pull my bike out of the driveway and onto the road, I'm grinning ear to ear. The worst dates are the best stories, and I was fully aware that I had just gotten one of each.

tl;dr: went out with a girl with way bigger problems than me, doesn't matter, didn't have sex.  
  
&amp;nbsp;


  
Bonus bad date since you liked that one so much:

I once went out with a girl in Portland whose every word was withering and cynical. There was literally nothing I could say that did not elicit sarcasm or dismissiveness. At first I chalked it up to nerves or insecurity, but then it got meaner, and then it just got ridiculous. So I decided to salvage things by coming back at her as biting and aggressive as she was being. When she (jokingly?) asked how long I'd been gay, I looked at my watch and said, ""about 40 minutes now."" 

Later I made a stillborn joke that genuinely seemed to bother her, and she explained that she worked as a nurse and had recently transported a stillborn baby through the hospital on a gurney. I asked if it was just lying there for everyone to see and she said no, that they covered it in a soft little blanket. Without a second thought, I asked ""Is that because the baby was cold? Because presumably... (I grin at her, anticipating my victory) it.. was.. cold."" In response, daggers shot from her eyes and she asked for the check. 

But the strangest moment came at the very end, when we stood outside the bar to say farewell and she said ""So when do you want to go out again?"" I was speechless. Through all the awfulness, the sarcasm and the meanness, she seemed to believe that things had been going well.

**Update 1:** Thank you guys so much for your kind comments and reddit gold. I really did not expect this response. I have about a half dozen completely outlined ideas for books, but the one chronicling my dating and relationship misadventures just shot to the top my priorities. Rilke said that loving another person is the most challenging thing any person will ever do, and I totally agree. But before you even get to that you have to meet them, which can be almost as difficult, as proven by this thread.

**Update 2:** Because I'm sure you're all wondering, here is the stillborn joke I told the second girl:  
  
When she asked if I had any siblings, I said:  
""Well, I have a younger brother...""  
(she feigns interest)  
""...he was stillborn...""  
(a flash of sympathy)  
""...but my parents decided to keep him...""  
(sympathy turns to fury)  
""...people ask me if it was strange growing up with a sibling who was.. dead...""  
(she's shaking her head now)  
""...it wasn't that strange. My parents taught me to treat him like any other baby...""  
(she looks around for the bartender)  
""...and we did! We'd take him to the park, push him on the swing, toss him down the slide.. I mean it's not like he ever cried...""  
(her eyes narrow)  
""...but I give my parents a lot of credit. They decided no matter what, they were going to raise him right...""  
(she stares at me blankly)  
""...and they did: as a stillborn-again Christian."" 

**Update 3:** I've been asked by several folks for more of my writing. I do have something on the subject that's a few years old, and it might be my best worst date of all. I've posted it over at /r/datinghell because it wouldn't fit in the comments. Enjoy?

Cyclocross race, staggered start. As a Junior racer, I jumped off the front with another guy right off the gun, and prepared myself for the mass passing of ~100 35+ and 50+ riders. Got to a muddy off-camber section not yet 3 minutes in, already passing like mad. My competitor squeaked by a 50+ rider, I attempted to do the same (calling out respectfully)...nope, cut off and bumped into a wire fence. Alright buddy. ""Comin' right instead!"" Move past, he takes no heed of my warning and swerves right into me, taking us both out. My competitor (eventual winner) turned into a distant speck. I yelled at the guy for messing with the front of the race. His response? ""Don't take it so seriously."" 

Finished the race mainly bothered by the swelling in my face from his tire, noticed at one point my leg was bleeding but paid no attention. 40 minutes later I finished 3rd (dammit) and was advised to go the med tent...lady's eyes got real big. Scrubbed the shit out of that thing....didn't hurt until the adrenaline wore down. Cue visit to the ER, 22 stitches, awkward bandaging for a couple weeks, ruined season.

***

In Japan, there was never a thought of surrendering before Germany. In 1944, the German military attache in Tokyo reported that the entire country was mobilizing as the tide of war turned against it. He reported the determination of the ""Japanese Army and the circles it influences to go through with the war without compromise on the side of Germany.""

The Portuguese minister to Japan reported in May 1944 that ""the fortification of coasts and mountains continues, giving the impression that this country, like Germany, is disposed to prosecute the war to its very end without the least probability of victory.""

In June 1944, Swiss minister Camille Gorge observed, ""Japan does not expect to win, but is still hoping to escape by prolonging the war long enough to exhaust [her] enemies.""

As Frank concludes: ""... no matter how desperate the situation, Japan intended to fight to the bitter end."" This was apparent as early as spring 1944, before the beginning of the strategic bombing campaign.

By 1945, it was clear that things were nearing an end. Japanese minister to Switzerland Shunichi Kase reported in April to Tokyo that he had ""rather concrete knowledge"" of a plan for Hitler (or other top Nazi leaders) to escape Germany to Japan on a long-range aircraft. On April 12, the Japanese military and naval attaches in Germany asked for a long-range aircraft that could fly from Norway to Japanese territory (likely over the pole to Manchuria, overflying the Soviet Union). The plane was to carry a German assistant air attache and one other passenger. The flight did not take place.

Kase later pushed for peace from his post in Bonn, saying that he had interviewed three Swiss banking officials who said ""Japan is not an object of world-wide detestation like Nazi Germany,"" and therefore should make a peace offer.

In late April, Tokyo radioed its officials in Europe, asking them to report ""as fully as possible"" on the last stage of resistance in Germany ""in order to furnish reference material for the Decisive Battle."" This was a reference to the expected invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The attache in Lisbon was told to pay particular attention to the training of civilian militias and what effect the direct participation of the German High Command and Hitler in combat had on civilian morale.

Magic intercepts in spring 1945 revealed instructions from the Japanese foreign ministry to its diplomats in Moscow. They needed to know what Soviet intentions would be following the surrender of Germany. The cancellation of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact on April 5 was seen as a sign that the Soviet Union would enter the war sooner, rather than later. Secretly, Stalin had promised Churchill and Roosevelt that he would enter the Pacific war within three months of the German surrender.

On April 30, the Supreme War Leadership Council met and decided ""to continue the war until the objective of the Greater East Asia War is achieved. To that end, Japanese diplomats were given instructions to try to feel out Soviet officials and see what the price would be to prevent the Soviet Union from entering the war. Barring that, they were to discern when and if the Soviet Union would enter the war. 

Not until August 2 did these instructions shift, and diplomats began tentative feelers to see under what circumstances the Allies would end the war.

Publicly, Japanese officials announced their intentions to fight on to the conclusion of the war. Kantarō Suzuki, the Prime Minister of Japan, declared in a radio announcement on May 3 (the day after Hitler's suicide) that the Japanese people should continue fighting with the spirit of a kamikaze pilot.

Shigenori Tōgō, Japan's minister of foreign affairs, stated: ""German actions [will] not affect the Empire's determination to pursue the war against the United States and Britain.""

On May 9, the day after Germany surrendered, the Japanese government declared that its objective the war was self-preservation and self-defense, so therefore Japan should be even more determined to defend itself against the United States and Britain, regardless of the situation in Europe.

Heck every phone I had 6-8 years had that feature. 


**Siri** which is considered one of their best piece of innovation has been a part of Android for years. The difference was the Siri talked back making you feel important while Android's voice search could do everything the first Siri could without talking back at you like an annoying GPS robot which we are already sick of already. By the time Siri started doing useful stuff Android's voice search had already been improved even more and I still find it more useful than Siri as it has better engines and apps supporting it which are easier, more productive and refined unlike Apple's apps which I got sick off in a day.


Nearly every single feature they pick up from ancient devices or even those currently in the market and they call it iCum etcetera to sell it. Yes it sells and thats their achievement but it really bothers me that these fan boys then have the nerve to call out other companies with better products and more innovation out by ""rytin lyk dis"".
I predict **Iphone5** or whatever it will be called will have something along the line of ""iDisplay"" letting you to some extent change the display of your phone which you can do in nearly every even ancient phone. How Apple ""just works"" I'll never know. thats like saying Windows 98 ""just worked"". The stupid phone does not even give a crash report when an app stops working and instead hides it like I never opened the app in the first place. Android is honest and lets you know the app has a problem so you can message the developer or just close it or even wait.

I had an iPhone 4s and a 3gs. I've also had the lowest end HTC and currently one of the best Android's in the market. The fact of the matter is that my cheap ass HTC running on android 2.3.5 did so much more than what you can ever do in the iPhone. It was also faster, more customizable and everything took less steps to do which is 100% opposite to what Apple fans say that ""it just works"". 

You think the iPhone ""just works""? Watch this 5 part video series if you've never had an Android and if you will still believe an apple ""it just works"".

The StarCraft II Legacy of the Void Beta is on  the way, and with **only two weeks left until its launch** we wanted to take a look at the goals and expectations around the multiplayer beta. As you are likely aware, we’ve been trying to be as open as possible with the status of our development, and **strongly believe that the increased cooperation between developers and players is beneficial to StarCraft II. To be clear, our goal for this expansion is to work together with all of you to make Legacy of the Void as awesome as possible.**

Anyways yesterday I landed on an amazing quote by Rothbard given in the introduction of ""Theory and History"".

&gt; For while many people are aware of the long and lone struggle that Ludwig von Mises waged against statism and on behalf of laissez-faire, few realize that there is far greater resistance in the economics profession to Mises' methodology than there is to his politics. Adherence to the free market, after all, is now not uncommon among economists (albeit not with Mises' unerring consistency), but few are ready to adopt the characteristically Austrian method which Mises systematized and named ""praxeology.""

I could not agree more with that. I spent my initial years with Austrian Economics thinking that mainstream economists hate Austrian economics for its libertarian leanings, but that's not true, the conclusions of Austrian Economics are quite acceptable to many people(as long as you don't say they are coming from Austrian Economics), its the Austrian Methodology which everybody in Economics profession hate.

Calling it homeopathy of real economics is much more easy than actually making a point against it. My graft with mainstream economics(and I would sincerely be excited about something like that) if it considered time preference or time as a factor, if everything is seen from a lens of single timeframe that's what really turns me off about mainstream economics. This is why the supposed pro-free market school ""Chicago school"" is as annoying to me as Keynesian school of economics. And inconsistency is another point against them(this is something where Maxian ideology scores higher than Keynesian/neo-classical economics).

But of course lugkuv65v4u65 you don't have to reply to any of the real criticisms you can just go back to making jabs about how Austrian Economics has no more consideration than [Phlogiston Theory of Fire](http://www.slate.com/id/9593/) or how is it the homeopathy of real economics.

You do realize that for a non-decided observer comments like ""homeopathy of real economics"" against constant attempts to hold a valid conversation sounds like that the former person just doesn't know his shit. You would be much more effective if you could think of a valid criticism and stick to it than saying things like ""Austrian Economics is the homeopathy of **real** economics""."

My uncle and I were finishing up chopping/gathering firewood for my grandmother because it was getting dark. Driving back on a dirt road at about 30mph (give or take 5mph) I had this awful sense of being watched. Before I could turn to look out my window (passenger side) my uncle quickly shouted, ""Don't!"" I completely froze. My heart felt like it was beating out of my chest then completely stopped when I heard a *tap tap* on my window. My uncle sped up and was loudly praying in my native language. I didn't know what was going on and thought it was over till our truck suddenly dipped from the bed. My uncle then started saying, ""Look at me"" and ""Don't turn away"" over and over. Then I heard it again, *tap tap* but from the window behind me. It was getting harder for me to breathe and I wanted to cry. A minute or two passed and the truck dipped again. My uncle looked around and sighed. It was quiet besides the truck and the road. He looked at me and said, ""We will ask your father to do a prayer in the morning. So the evil will forget our faces.""

Seinfeld was quick paced, witty, and introduced chaos and complicated multi-layered plots (like George lying about being a marine biologist and Kramer hitting golf balls into the ocean, boom beached whale, etc. etc.) to television audiences that made older sitcoms feel stale. Look at the sitcoms to follow--*Malcolm in the Middle*, *Arrested Development*, *The Office,* *30 Rock,* *Modern Family*, *Sunny*, *Community*, *Parks and Rec*, all are/were successful, and follow the Seinfeld model. All also appeal to a younger audience, and for the most part were/are considered edgy.

CBS as a network panders to an older audience. Shows are more formulaic (2.5 Men, Raymond, TBBT, dot dot dot) and to the average audience feels repetitive, recycled, and stale. They didn't quite evolve the same way, and that's why CBS sucks in a nutshell.  "

Eurasianism is a complicated ideology, but it basically calls for a multipolar world, with different spheres of influence.

Putin uses Eurasianism, like the Soviets, as a geopolitical strategy in many cases. Kazakh President basically took early Eurasianism and turned it into a logical and realistic idea: The EEU.

A couple minutes later, the professor walks in, already covered in chalk. Without even making eye contact, he starts lecturing, facing the board. An hour and a half later, at the end of a sentence, he just stops talking, writes Assignment #1: Problems 1a,e,f. 2abc. and so on...finishes, and walks out. Still, not having introduced himself, provided a summary of the class, or anything.

Looking at the associated scholarly article the main finding is that the ""all-cause mortality hazard ratio"" for those who sat 4-8 hours a day is 1.02, and 1.40 for those who sit 11+ hours a day. I will trust that they say they accounted for other confounding factors like physical activity (though it's hard to imagine a marathon runner who sat 11 hours a day). The studied population was aged 45 and over. So, there is a 40% increased likelihood of death in those who sat for 11+ hours a day, vs 4-8. That's not the same as a 40% chance of dying.

Hat tip to greenthoughts.) 

More detail: In the US, the death rate for 45-54 year olds in 2004 was [423.1 per 100,000](http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=587), or 0.423%. (It's lower for younger people over 1 year old, and higher for older people. For those 25-34 year old Redditors, it's 100.5 per 100,000, or almost exactly my erroneous orignal 0.1%. Cool! For 15-24 year olds it is only 0.08%) 

40% more likely than 0.423% (age 45-54) is an increased death rate of 0.169%. (Back to 0.04% for 25-34 year olds.) So there's an estimate of the order of magnitude of the increased likelihood of death. It's still small for most of us, but age dependent. For those 85+, the US death rate is almost 14%. 40% more than that is 19.6%.. almost 6% higher. There's a difference worth noting.

From what I've seen of people installing standing desks in my office, you could be more likely to give yourself a concussion adjusting the desk height than you are to prevent your death.

I'm sure (some) extreme sports have a higher increase in all-cause mortality than sitting all day.

You should get up, move around, eat right, get exercise and all that, but you shouldn't stress over sitting on your ass and not having a standing desk unless you have a lot of other risk factors. 0.04% to 0.169% is not a huge increase.

That's why we didn't have piles of dead office workers in the streets as we moved away from manufacturing and farm labor a hundred years ago.

Edit: Adding a link to [Cornell Ergonomics Lab](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html) (hat tip to harlows_monkeys), with an actual useful discussion of the ergonomics of the situation. Turns out standing desks may not be so great after all if you just stand there motionless all day. I guess there's a lot of history with factory line workers standing all day.

Edit: [greenthoughts](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/sldyp/a_study_of_more_than_200000_australians_adds_to/c4f4b3j) clarified the meaning of hazard ratio. I was lead astray by a quick search on the internet. So, the absolute risk is not something we have. However we can estimate the magnitude of it by using overall death rates, as above."

I sat for another second or two, as that rotten sound reverberated around the room. This all happened in an instant. Slowly, I slid my hands backwards, getting them into a suitable position to shove myself upwards and out of my chair. My back was to the door, and as I eased myself out of my seat, I began to pivot to face the door, and the source of this hideous sound.
Just then I thought I heard another knock, but the sound quickly grew into a crash. I was promptly showered with splinters and bits of drywall as the door burst off of the hinges and the walls surrounding it also gave way. With the incredible shock of this new development, as well as the sheer force of the crash itself, I was knocked backwards onto the ground.

 I opened my eyes as the dust cleared, and sat staring at the bulbous, bleeding shape staggering into my room. Some sort of demon, was it? The blood sloshed around his transparent head, spilling out of the top and badly staining what was left of my walls and carpet. Foul demon, why have you come here?

Then I noticed his stagnant, hideous grin.

It was the Kool-Aid Man.

And he had broken through my wall.

It wasn’t blood. It was just Kool-Aid, and his body was simply the familiar glass pitcher with a friendly smile. I remembered his commercials almost at once, and just as quickly, the fear subsided and was replaced instead with incredible excitement.

“Ohhh Yeahhh!” He said, in that familiar, gruff, yet laid-back voice of his. “I got just the thing for a kid on the go like you to hydrate himself!”

He chucked a box of Kool-Aid at my head from his white-gloved hand.

“But I’m not a kid on the go…” I tried to explain as the Kool-Aid smacked my cheek and fell harmlessly to the ground. “I’m 27 years old! And plus, it’s a nuclear holocaust outside! I can’t even leave my room!”

The living pitcher just stared at me.

Ever smiling, as his sugary lifeblood sloshed around inside his head. Or was it his torso?

We continued to blankly stare at each other, my words hovering between us for what seemed like an eternity.

Vile creature!

Foul deliverer of children’s drinks!

What did he want from me?

Was this the form the angel of death had chosen? Is he finally here to deliver me to The Beast?

His horrible unblinking eyes stared, judging my soul, and I, The Last Man on Earth, suddenly felt a pang of regret for taking The Last Hit of Acid on Earth.

We sat there for twenty minutes, unmoving, not speaking. The Kool-Aid inside him eventually settled, as he stood statue-like in the remnants of my doorway. This demonic staring contest had no end.

I eased my hand backwards towards my chair over the course of this time, slithering my arm closer and closer towards the only semblance of a weapon nearby – the wooden leg of my chair. 

There was nothing I could do, after all.

It was apparent that the Kool-Aid Man had to die.

My adrenaline kicked in, and in one swift motion, with only one hand, I managed to completely tear off the leg of my chair. Screaming, I leapt to my feet, expecting some sort of reaction from my visitor. He did not move.

Filled with a sudden, divine power, I charged.

Never having learned exactly how to defeat a post-apocalyptic, hellspawned commercial spokeman, I chose the tried and true method – the stake through the heart.

I swooped in on him, and delivered my righteous chair leg through the center of his face, in lieu of the heart. The glass shattered much too easily, almost like an eggshell, leaving a gaping hole in his face. Kool-Aid gushed from his body; still he stood. I gasped, bathing in the liquid pouring from his evil figure. It was remarkably viscous Kool-Aid.

A moment passed. My hair and clothes were now dyed red from the Shower of Beverage.

He didn’t react. He just stood there as the Kool-Aid drained from his system. Still grinning; mocking me. He had to die, now more than ever.

It wasn’t until the last drop had left his head that he finally dropped to his knees. Deliverer of happiness… ever smiling. I backed away from his huge torso, and immediately, that hideous grin went slamming into the floor.

His head completely shattered. I was left with nothing but a pair of arms and legs, and a puddle of Kool-Aid so deep you could bathe in it.

I panted for a moment, relieved, and then I chucked my impromptu weapon onto his battered corpse.

Then I went into the kitchen and fixed myself a delightful glass of pink lemonade, and a Hot Pocket. They were good, but I forgot to put a plate under the Hot Pocket, and some of the filling dripped out into my microwave."

15248,,,,,81,"Well, the illustration was made in 2011, around the time of the announcement that the Shuttle program was ending. The picture is of a flaming astronaut walking across [6th Avenue in Manhattan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Avenue_\(Manhattan\)). The only information I can find about the illustration is this quote attributed to crossing: ""This was a concept for a band in the states, they decided not to go with it. Instead My brothers label is going to use it.""

In that context, who knows the meaning? It's for a music thing, which have pictures that rarely make sense, it seems. 

Sitting down here at my computer at one in the morning, I see the following meaning: Crossing is anguished/despairing at the recent cancellation of the Shuttle Program. He thinks that these budget cuts will separate America from her past achievements in space, specifically the lunar landings, as evidenced by use of a lunar space suit. He blames this on business and commercialism, as evidenced by the situation of the burning space suit in Manhattan. He feels that space is being ignored, and has become just another humdrum thing that people see and forget about. It's just another pedestrian in the crosswalk, and Crossing is pointing out that space is so much more. "

Dude was also ugly.  I'm no Fabio myself, but man, he was seriously ugly.  Anyway, his greatest ambition was to lose his virginity in college.

So one night Freshman year we all went to a party, and he went back to the dorm rip roaring drunk.  We figured he would black out, so we set up the plan.  We grabbed a pair of panties from a willing female friend, and dropped them in his room. Then we signed in/out a fake girl's name with the security desk so it looked like he signed someone in.  Then we waited...

The next day we kept asking him about that ""hot goth girl"" he took to his room the night before.  At first he was confused, then accepting, then proud as hell.   Eventually he started regaling us with stories on how long he lasted, what positions, etc.  

On one hand, we felt terrible, but on the other, it was effing hilarious.  Actually did wonders for his confidence with the ladies too."

There was ONE moment where he fell off that--when the guy asked about immigrants' impact on the Texas example he gave, after he'd already answered that. He was a little snarky for a second about how ""you have to listen to what I said"", and then IMMEDIATELY snaps back to respect, apologizes for his tone (which was SHOCKING and AWESOME), and comes right back to a totally rational conversation.

Anonymous has never been about doing good deeds. ""Freedom of information""? That had nothing to do with censorship or freedom of speech. All it really means is, ""freedom to pirate stuff"". That was what Operation Payback was all about. The RIAA hired hackers to take down websites used for piracy, so Anonymous started DDoSing the RIAA. The only other function of Anonymous was to play sick pranks on children. That is their core, their foundation, and anything they've done since has only been for recruitment and image purposes.

17357,Emily is useless without something of YOURs to target.,Greg is useless without something of YOURs to target.,Jamal is useless without something of YOURs to target.,Lakisha is useless without something of YOURs to target.,10.0,"Cards like Reverb/Veng/**Curse of Stalked Prey** are force amplifiers. They strengthen the cards you already have.
The reason they are bad in RDW is twofold.  

1. RDW relies on every card in your deck getting you 'Closer' to your objective. Reverberate/Increasing Vengeance/Curse of Stalked Prey all require you to have other things to be successful. It then requires a balance of burn spells/other spells in order to be effective. Reverberate is useless without something else to target. Veng is useless without something of YOURs to target. (CoSP is useless without creatures to swing after its up).  
If you get one of those cards late in the game, they can't win you the game because you might not have anything to amplify to greater strength.  
2. You don't have the resources. RDW is about efficiency. All of your spells want to be lightning bolt or goblin guide (Pretty much).  
If you have cards in your deck that make you stronger, but take you mana/a turn to cast, you might not get enough value out of it compared to running another threat or another burn spell.  
Imagine casting T1: Stromkirk, T2: CoSP, T3: Chandra's Pheonix. By the end of T3 you have: a 5/5 and a 3/3. You've dealt 6 damage to the opponent in three turns. Now the opponent stabilizes with a wrath.
Compare it to T1: Stromkirk, T2: Nothing, T3: Chandra's Pheonix. By the end of T3 you have: a 3/3 and a 2/2. You've dealt 5 damage to the opponent in three turns. Now the opponent stabilizes with a wrath.  

The difference in those situations was a minor growing buff if you're already winning. In the second scenario, you could've used a burn spell to ensure your creature connected, dropped another creature or something else. Curse of Stalked Prey takes development time.  

Going into the second part of 'Resources' is what you top out at. RDW kind of wants to top out at 3-5 lands. While you don't have the mana to Reverberate/Vengeance one of your spells, they are dead cards. They are card disadvantage, card disadvantage that might just lose you the game.  

This kind of got a bit long winded.  

tl;dr: They trend towards card disadvantage because you don't have the resources/cards they make stronger. This can cost you a game if you needed something that is cheaper/threatening on its own."

**Edit**: Maybe I should have just linked directly to this article instead. Too late now.

Lansing - House Republicans prohibited state Rep. Lisa Brown from speaking on the floor Thursday after she ended a speech Wednesday against a bill restricting abortions by referencing her female anatomy.

Brown, a West Bloomfield Democrat and mother of three, said a package of abortion regulation bills would violate her Jewish religious beliefs that pregnancy be aborted to save the life of the mother.

""Finally, Mr. Speaker, I'm flattered that you're all so interested in my vagina, but 'no' means 'no,'"" Brown said Wednesday.

Brown's comment prompted a rebuke Thursday by House Republicans, who wouldn't allow her to voice her opinion on a school employee retirement bill.

""What she said was offensive,"" said Rep. Mike Callton, R-Nashville. ""It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women. I would not say that in mixed company.""

Brown's comments were published in Thursday's Detroit News.

Majority Floor Leader Jim Stamas, R-Midland, determined Brown's comments violated the decorum of the House, said Ari Adler, spokesman for the Republican majority.

""If I can't say the word vagina, why are we legislating vaginas?"" Brown asked Thursday at a hastily called Capitol press conference. ""What language should I use?""

Brown noted ""vagina"" is the ""medically correct term.""

""We're all adults here,"" she said.

The House tabled a bill Wednesday that would ban all abortions after 20 weeks with a narrow exemption for the life of the mother after passing a bill with new regulations for abortion providers.

House Republicans also wouldn't let state Rep. Barb Byrum speak on the House floor today.

Byrum, D-Onondaga, caused a disturbance on the House floor Wednesday when she wasn't allowed to introduce an amendment to the abortion regulations bill banning men from getting a vasectomy unless the sterilization procedure was necessary to save a man's life.

""If we truly want to make sure children are born, we would regulate vasectomies,"" Byrum told reporters Thursday.

No general knowledge is required for this quiz; there is an arts and crafts round and an ""adventure story round"". One round however was called ""true, false or bullshit"". This was the explanation of the round that Pico gave:

""If I say, for example, that rats can go longer without water than a camel...that would be true! But it I said that falcons can go longer without water than a camel...that would be false. If I said, however, that camels sometimes use their humps as sex-toys...well that would be bullshit"".

* And speaking of fonts, is there any particular reason why you stick to core web fonts and Lakisha for every goddamn thing?",74.0,"So when will you actually start to improve the technical quality of the service to the point that it could actually compete with fansubs?

I've been following the site and the technical quality of the service you offer for a long time, and there have been hardly any improvements after the site went legit.

* You offer 720p video, but you use 1500 kbps bitrate for every single thing with mediocre x264 encoding settings. The result is that basically every single show on CrunchyRoll has [notable banding in the video](http://i.imgur.com/Fgg2s.png) (compare this to a [HDTVrip](http://s3.postimage.org/napro745e/streaming_quality_comparison_tv.png) of the same thing) and as someone who watches anime on a 1080p screen it is very notable and bothersome. Beyond that, I've seen plenty of encoding errors pop up every now and then, [like this one just last season](http://i.imgur.com/mKrhL.png). Can't you use variable bitrate (CRF mode in x264, so that more demanding episodes get more bitrate and less demanding episodes get less) or at least bump the bitrate up to 2000kbps and use better compression settings?
* On another note, a friend of mine (who is an audio nut) has also noted that the AAC encoder that you guys use is pretty terrible. Japanese TV broadcasts tend to have better audio quality, and their AAC encoders aren't that top-notch either.
* The subtitle renderer has hardly improved at all. Because of its limits, typesetting is also incredibly bare. I see some subbers actually try to at least rudimentary typesetting within the limits of the renderer, but most subbers don't seem to even bother and just put the sign text into some edge of the video in the same font as the dialogue. Well-done typesetting can really enhance the anime-viewing experience, so it's honestly a shame that you have to resort to illegal alternatives in order to basically get any. Compare [this](http://i.imgur.com/Zonlp.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/0zcl4.jpg) for example. Or [this](http://i.imgur.com/z9Okx.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/kxf5B.gif).
* And speaking of fonts, is there any particular reason why you stick to core web fonts and Trebuchet MS for every goddamn thing? It can't be an issue of money, since there are tons of free-for-commercial-use fonts out there that work great for subtitles. Just check out [FontSquirrel](http://fontsquirrel.com) for example. Another annoyance with CR in comparison to local file playback is the fact that if the subtitle styling on CrunchyRoll is terrible (not enough vertical/horizontal margin, font is tiny, [inappropriate threeliners](http://i.imgur.com/S9Z0e.jpg)) there is absolutely nothing that the user can do about it. With local files, I can at least change the dialogue styling to my liking.
* And last but not least, please add chapters to your videos. Considering the pathetic buffering capabilities, it would help a damn lot if you could skip past the OP/ED with 100% accuracy just by pressing a single button. This is once again a feature fansubs have offered for years yet not streaming service seem to have catched on.
* EDIT: One more thing - the quality of timing. The timing quality seems to have been quite terrible this year. Many series have the subtitles timed so that continuous lines have annoying gaps between them, which are very jarring and distracting. Scenebleeds also seem quite common. I guess one reason scenebleeds could happen is that the watermarked workraw that the translators have to work with might differ by some frames from the final video that goes up on CR, in which case I guess you'd need to educate the companies providing the video on the matter. Anyway, beyond that, especially this season (2011 Spring) the timing has had atrocious mistakes. Take Astarotte's Toy for example - many lines are split in completely awkward places, resulting in linechanges practically mid-word. There have also been mistimings where the the timer timed a line into a previous line, leaving the actual line completely unsubbed. My Ordinary Life also had the same, which resulted in one of the infamous ""?""-lines. You guys really ought to have some quality control for the people you hire for the subtitling jobs. Or just have proper quality control in general - there's been way too much post-release patching for major fuckups this season.
* There's also one thing a friend of mine has complained about - the translation of GOSICK. It seems like the translations for different episodes are done by approximately three different translators, and they're completely inconsistent in their terminology and translation ideology. One doesn't leave any Japanese honorifics into the translation (which makes total sense, since the show takes place in a pseudo-French setting), one keeps honorifics in, and one *adds honorifics in where there are none.* The last one also seems to do quite a lot of translation errors. All in all, since he's a big fan of the series, he can't help but feel very disappointed about the substandard it seems to be getting on CR.

I mean really, it's just pretty pathetic to see CR being stuck technically in the year 2007-2008 while fansubs are truly in the year 2011. I'm not even asking that much of you; I know you can't realistically reach the same level of typesetting as the best fansubs have because the CR subtitle renderer would have to be at least as capable as VSFilter/libass to achieve that (and I don't see that happening anytime soon). Get some variety to the fonts, make all the subbers do typesetting at least to the degree that can be done with the subtitle renderer, add some new features to it so even more can be done, if you can't increase the bitrate of video try adding a debanding filter to the Flash player (no idea how hard this would be to do technically, though), add chapters... At that point I'd probably stop watching the illegal releases for their better quality and just use CrunchyRoll for my anime needs. Or well, at least I'd regularly pay for a subscription and play the episodes in the background while I watch the HorribleSubs rips, since I like to watch my media locally."

It was like the president was stepping back from this whole political game to say, ""what the fuck?""

Fun fact: Narwhals practice dentistry! It's normally the younger, subordinate narwhals practicing on the older, senior narwhals.

A subordinate narhwhal will proceed to break off a small section of his tooth into the open hole of the senior's tooth creating a ""filling"" of sorts.

Here is an excerpt:

&gt; ""A type of dentistry may be practiced among narwhals in that the broken tusk of one individual may be plugged with the tip of another's tusk. Although some have described this as being the result of ""head-on collisions"", this is unlikely considering the accuracy that would have to be involved (or, more precisely, the extremely low probability of such collisions occurring coincidentally). Because this ""capping"" of the tusk is unlikely to have happened by chance, it is possible that this is an altruistic act. There are accounts by Arctic indigenous people of seeing young narwhals aligning the tips of their tusks with the broken tusks of older males and, apparently, deliberately snapping the very tips of their tusks off to block open tooth cavities. A narwhal's tusk is hollow and filled with pulp and contains a sizeable nerve, which is exposed would presumably be extremely painful. One could see why this unusual behavior might develop in a social cetacean species. roken tusks have also been found with the tips crammed with sand and gravel, perhaps from an attempt to cap the broken tusk by jamming the broken tooth into the seabed.""

29420,,,,,-11,"&gt;idea that every male at war is a homosexual. 

At this point I realized that you are white, male and straight. Rape in prison and the army is never done by men who are in their everyday life homosexual. It is always hyper masculine stereotypical alpha males who do it to show their power over others. 

People who I have talked to that served in old Yugoslavian army would tell stories about how once someone was found out to be gay they would be beaten, bullied and humiliated until they more often than not killed themselves. Less than 5 years later this same army would go on and rape some 80% of prisoners in the concentration camps it was running. 

As for the point you and everyone else has made that we don't have statistics from medieval times on male rapes during war that is true. However we do know that for most of the period homosexuality was punishable by death. We can draw comparisons to societies where that is the case for women today: for example Saudi Arabia has one of the worlds lowest recorded rape rates, much lower than anywhere in Scandinavia for both men and women. Yet any GNO working there will tell you that it is possibly as high as one in three. I picked Africa because it is poor enough that the niceties of modern society haven't penetrated there much and war there would be closest to what medieval war looked like. However it would still be a vast improvement since the standard of living even in the Kongo is much higher than it ever was in medieval Europe/Westeros.

&gt;Rape is perfectly fine to include, but GRRM isn't dumb enough to go too overboard. 

He has a woman raped by 50 men in less than a few hours. I'd say he goes overboard whenever possible. As for Pycel being sexually rape with a broom stick and dying, his body being found with it still in, that would have been parity with all the viciously horrible things we are constantly told happen to women. Hell someone could have just said how they found him and it would have been an excellent way to show equal opportunity rapiness."

Your PC can do what the OUYA does. Your phone can do what the OUYA does. But developing a console game for EITHER of those devices is stupid. The OUYA opens up the console market for indies. Indes CAN develop games that can ONLY be played with a controller and release them to the android market right now. You know how many people are going to pay for a game FOR THEIR PHONE that can ONLY be played when they have a ps3 controller and TV handy. Nobody. Because that is a small fraction of the time their phone is available. For somebody that buys an OUYA they are paying for a CONSOLE. Not a phone hooked up to a TV. A console. 

The Ouya has plenty of other kool aid properties but your sole argument is the single most naive one. A console that sells 38k copies is not a huge market. An Indie game will probably only ever appeal or be seen by maybe a quarter of that. It's specs will likely be out of date by the time it's even released and since its customizable devs will have to develop for the original specs or risk not being compatible with modded ouya's. And at the moment an stable online community is a lot of money to maintain. Who knows if the Ouya team can create or afford the infrastructure to maintain that network. 

But at the same time. People want this. The XBLA has a high entry point and developing for the PSN costs a lot of money to get in. Being able to develop an android game for a console is a huge deal and if the OUYA takes off at all this will be huge for indie developers and even if it doesnt we've all just proven we want an indie console and albeit small there is a market out there if a company is willing to shell out the money. People are skeptical because they are unproven. If Sony or Microsoft or Google made this device with everything 100% identical people would eat it right up.

And again arguing your phone can do what the Ouya can do is a wasteful argument because the ouya is not trying to be your phone. It just happens to have the same hardware in a different confirguration."

&gt;He said the fed needs to create a housing bubble to keep the economy going!

Prediction, not request. 

Question: if Krugman wanted a ""bubble"", using and meaning those exact words, then [why did he call for action in 2005 when it was clear that the housing market was in, and I quote the exact term he used, a ""bubble""](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/08/opinion/08krugman.html)?

Actually, it was McCulley that first called Greenspans' bubble; Krugman merely paraphrased him. **Here is the original quote Krugman referred to**:

&gt;There is room for the Fed to create a bubble in housing prices, if necessary, **to sustain American hedonism**. And I think the Fed has the will to do so, even though political correctness would demand that Mr. Greenspan deny any such thing.""

Question: is the above speaker genuinely hoping that Greenspan will create a bubble to sustain ""American hedonism""(yay hedonism!), or making a prediction about what he'll probably do?

&gt;He said there should be a new bubble to replace the old one on Spanish TV!

Now this is getting really dishonest...**Krugman was quoting [the Onion headline](http://www.theonion.com/articles/recessionplagued-nation-demands-new-bubble-to-inve,2486/) about people looking for a new bubble**. The quote on Mises is hacked up with ellipses, and they refuse to provide the entire thing unedited. But you can read what Krugman thought of the Onion article on his blog. He sees it as a statement of the market's frenzy to find something new to throw their money at. [Here's Krugman referencing the Onion in his blog around the same time, very obviously referring to absurdity of it and not, as Mises claims, using it as a guiding economic policy.](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/state-of-the-onion/) As the person he linked to said, ""[If it wasn't so sad, it would be hysterical](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/07/headline-of-t-1.html).""

&gt;He called for interest rate cuts in 2001! That proves it!

They say he ""must"" have meant it because he called for interest rate cuts in 2001, when the economy was in a slump. They seem ignorant of the fact that both the fed and the economists that offer advice for them re-assess interest rates every 6 months or so.

&gt;Ok then, but he DID want the housing boom to drive the economy

If you take that to mean Krugman wanted a bubble, it appears to be based on a confusion between what a speculative bubble is and what an economic driver is. While they can go hand in hand, the two are different things.

In layman's terms, a ""bubble"" seems to have become synonymous with ""any big boom in the economy, which will inevitably come to an end with a backlash"". If you believe in Business Cycle theory, you're very inclined to think that, since that concept is fundamental to the theory's model of how the economy works (Boom-Bust).

But a ""bubble"" is not defined as ""bad shit that happens after seemingly good stuff happened"". A speculative bubble is defined as ""trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance with intrinsic values"".

In other words: Investors drive up the price of a good. Others, seeing the price rise, assume it must be a great investment, driving the price up even further. This cycle continues, until someone tries to sell the good at the (ridiculously overvalued) price. When people are unable to sell, the price drops to realistic levels, and all the money people had on paper vanishes. And worse, if they bought the good at the overvalued price, they're in debt with no way to recoup. (I'd like to point out that as much as Austrians worship gold, it's perfectly possible for the above scenario to happen with that good, too).

However, bubbles do not have to go hand in hand with economic drivers. It's perfectly valid for a housing boom to stimulate the economy...if houses are actually needed, and of benefit to people who genuinely need to buy them and are willing and capable of getting them at the market price. The problem is when prices move out of sync with what the market can bear. And that is where the fed can step in.

You might disagree with that, and believe that *any* manipulation in interest rates will inevitably lead to a bubble, and that therefore anyone that believes in the power of the fed wants one. But keep in mind, when you say that, you go against 100 years of mainstream economic thought, not just this guy specifically.

8905,,,,,15.0,"""In fact, there are numerous other channels (other than potential decreased employment) through which the higher wage is absorbed:

–profits: to the extent that the increase is paid for out of profits, we shouldn’t expect job losses. And in an economy where profits have dazzled while paychecks have fizzled, that ain’t a bad thing.

–prices: some studies find that a small bit gets passed through to higher prices.

–productivity: to the extent that higher wages reduce turnover and vacancies, a higher minimum can partially pay for itself by squeezing out such inefficiencies. It’s not wishful thinking—some studies have found just that.

–reasonable rates: it matters what the level you raise it to, and historically, increases have affected less than 10% of the workforce, often even smaller shares. With relatively few in the “affected range” we wouldn’t expect to see large distortions.

–it’s stimulus! Minimum wage workers tend to spend the extra cash, so there’s more economic activity than otherwise would occur—btw, even under the redistributive scenario described under “profits” above, you’ll get this effect if low-wage workers consume more of their last dollar than those in the sky boxes.""

Not 40 years ago, it was commonplace for farmers to cull the heard of their farmcats by putting them in a sack and drowning them.  It sounds cruel by current standards, but let's face it - the animals are going to die at some point in the near future anyway if there isn't enough food to go around, or if people are going to throw them into the wild at that young an age, or if the get taken to an animal shelter in a rural area.  [""56 percent of dogs and 71 percent of cats that enter animal shelters are euthanized. More cats are euthanized than dogs because they are more likely to enter a shelter without any owner identification. ""](http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/fact-sheets/animal-shelter-euthanasia.html)  It's a terrible truth, but one way or another, those dogs were very likely to die.  Plus, fuck reddit for holding someone from another country (this is based on the comments here) responsible for your hipster, privileged belief structures.  Someone said croatia - which is a war-ravaged country.  Frankly, those dogs were probably done a favor rather than starving to death, freezing to death, being eaten, or getting blown up by stray Serbian landmines.

I still have not done research, so, to the extent that I have miscategorized Croatia (which I will point out I don't know if this girl was from there, I merely read it in someone's post), I apologize.  HOWEVER - the point remains the same that this is not uncommon in many places, may not carry the same social stigma in said places as it does here on reddit, and therefore it is unfair for any of us to judge the person acting based on our set of social mores (with an accent of the ""e"", thanks).

You asked how do they know to change gears but I may as well explain the whole thing. PLEASE NOTE THIS CUTS ALOT OF CORNERS TO SIMPLIFY IT.


There are many different systems, but there are 3 main systems (exculding CVT's), hydraulic operated automatics (relatively old school, although still used), computer controlled (allot smoother and more responsive) and Semi Automatic Manuals. 


I will initally talk about hydraulic operated automatics as they are purely mechanical and are probably the most interesting. Natrually in a gearbox you want a reduction in engine shaft speed to or near ground speed (depending on diff ratio). Before I go any further a gearbox is there to multiply torque through changing shaft speeds, it does not multiply power (you can never multiply power). People need to realise that Torque is the abilty to do work and Power is the rate at which I can do it. 


But anyway this is done in an automatic through a plantery gear set (http://appauto.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/planetarygearset.jpg). This consists of a Sun gear, Plantery gear and a Ring gear, and has a few really cool tricks. With a normal gear set we supply power to one gear that turns another thus gearing it up or down depending on the ratio, with a plantery set we have 3 places to introduce shaft speed and we can remove it from the either of the two remianing gears, and we can stop or allow the other remainding gear to rotate. For example 


    Input           Output           Held Gear               Gearing
    Sun             Planet            Ring                       Up
    Planet         Ring               Sun                        Down
    Sun             Ring              Planet                     Reverse


But this only what is called a 2 speed, more 'speeds' are added by using more gear sets either in series or parrellel, they also allow for alot of really cool tricks, most of which are probably outside of this basic explaination, but if you are interested this video gives a good basic understanding (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQhzruw2Qh8&amp;feature=related).


But how do we select which gear is the input and output and which gear is locked? By the use of Bands and Clutches. A Band is literally what it sounds like, its a band that wraps around the Ring gear holding it in place, locking it to the gear box case. The clutch (usual a basket clutch like a motorcycle) perform several functions like locking the sun gear to the input shaft. So by actuating the bands and clutches at different times and what not we can acheive different gear ratios.
.

But now you are probably thinking right so there is a planetry gearbox that is all magical and just magically decides when to change gear. Well this is the cool bit and why I love pure hyrdraulic automatics. Now remember those Bands and Clutches you are probably going but wtf actuates these? Hydraulics, awesomely designed Hydraulics, most people are aware of electronic logic gates, the same exists in hydraulics. I will keep this as simple as possible, as most people get lost here (if I havent already lost you). 


**Answer to Orignal Question** 
On the input shaft of the automatic gear box is a hydraulic pump that produces pressure, on the output shaft (usually) there is a centrifugal governor, basically the faster it spins the more pressure it allows into the hydraulic circuit. In real layman terms this is what selects each gear. But realality is far more awesome, remember how pressure is related to speed? well it is also related to strain on the gearbox, this is how in some cases it knows how to change down (not all gearboxes use this but). This Pressure is then sent into a hydraulic circuit that uses what I will call logic gates, depending on flow rate and pressure and the current engaded circuit it opens pressure into a piston that then forces onto a belt or a band or some combination, hence selecting the right gear. Here is an example of a cirucit (http://www.seekic.com/uploadfile/ic-circuit/2011912639162.gif), seem simple right? Yeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh. They are even funner in real life (http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/automatic-transmission-brain.jpg)


Now Remeber how I said this is the old school type of auto? Neither of the photos I just gave was of a Old school auto (I think) they dont really seem right, but this is only an explaination so they are good enough for a reference, I cant find any ""good"" old photos.  Now this why I am not a real fan of modern automatics. They use the ECU and usually take input such as brake pressure, engine rpm, gearbox speed, throttle position (and even rate of application) and even things like steer angle in some, then operate electric actuatuated that allow pressure onto pistons that acutuate the bands or clutches etc etc. Smoother, more effiecent, yes, but the awesome hydraulic circuits are sadly gone.


Now probably thinking sweet this sounds good (or your head has exploded), but what is this Torque converter I hear so much about? Up until this stage I have not mentioned anything about how we engade or disengade drive at idle. Right, imagine a boat propeller, it spinning moves the boat forward? Yes, now imagine if we held the boat stationary, it would move the water. right? now magine if we put a second propeller in that water and held what ever it was attachted to stationary, the propeller would spin. This is this the basis of the torque converter, although with less boating action (sadly). 
A really good video (again from the 1950s and the US army) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8EHTTNPEg). But this is the cool part, a torque converter as you probably imagine from the name, multiples torque, but it varies with the relative speed of the two impellers (its what the earlier propellers are actually callgger difference bigger torque. Torque converters also cause the slop you usually notice in auto's as fluid is being acted on a impeller and then acting on another, this all has mass (hence inerita) and takes time to act.etc etc


More sportier and in my experience most modern cars then use a clutch in the middle of the torque converter, this allows the torque converter to do its thing  like allow the engine to idle and multiply torque off the line, but then at high rpms it locks the torque converter together (and thus negating it) meaning better throttle repsonse and better fuel economy (no losses in the torque converter). Random side note this is usual given as the reason for why Americans used to drive big v8's and alike, torque converters were intially very inefficient and very heavy requiring big engines to move then around.


And finally Semi-Automatics especially in really expensive cars, are just normal manuals that are just controlled by the ECU. Efficient? yes. Quick to change? Hell yes. As big of a mind fuck? Not really.


**TLDR (everyone):Hydraulic pump makes pressure depending on speed, this then acutates a piston that selects a gear. Some unicorn blood may or may not be involved. Watch the videos linked above**
Also if you have any other questions, I really dont mind answering them.

Look for a massive push by Hillary Clinton's camp to ""reseat"" delegates from Michigan and Florida, which were taken away by the DNC previously.  

Florida is probably similar, but I'm in Michigan, and I can tell what I feel is happening here.

Michigan is home to Detroit, which has about 900k people, 700k-ish of which are African American, in a state of about 10M people.

Some months ago, it was clear that Obama was Clinton's #1 competitor. If he was even marginally successful, Detroit's vote, along with other cities with large/majority African American populations, such as Flint or Grand Rapids, would give Obama an easy victory in Michigan, and despite our losses, we're still a top 10 state.

So, our Governor Jennifer Granholm, who endorses Hillary Clinton, agreed to hold an early primary (Jan 15, 2008), probably knowing that Hillary Clinton's friends within the DNC would then cut our votes out of the Democratic Nomination, eliminating this advantage for Obama and giving Clinton the edge she needs. Michigan Republicans, seeing a chance to make the Democrats look bad by ignoring Michigan voters, agreed, and the changes sailed through.

And that's exactly what happened.

Clinton broke her pledge not to campaign here, stayed on the ballot when all of the other democrats pulled out, and won a pointless victory.

Now there is talk that our Governor Granholm is joining the Clinton administration, for all of her ""help"" in ""winning"" Michigan.

""help"" in suppressing the black vote.

And we can expect Clinton to push hard to make those delegate votes count again.  Delegates selected without the favored candidate of the likely majority of Democratic voters.

It's just another way to ""keep the black man down""

How sad.

The sentece ""Germans were never ""manipulated""."" is just plain wrong. No country or men is plain evil and does things just for the cause of it. It takes propaganda (goering) and a desperate need for unity to create an environment in wich people start to behave like that. At that time jews in germany were seen just like afro-americans in the south of the US. The only difference was that this behaviour was backed by the government and heavily encouraged. So if you let people behave like they want to they start to kill each other thats why we established laws so despotism could be stoped. If you leave one group out of this, the others start to take advantage for themselfs of it, and radicals start to cross the line every day.
Same thing would happen (and is happening) today. Just look where-ever groups are deamonised and law is to weak to protect them, it ends in supression, killing and in extreme cases genocid.

Back story:

I used to work for one of the largest plumbing and fixture companies out there.  When the housing market crashed the CEO decided he'd rather keep his jet and slashing IT payroll is one of the easiest ways to save money.

Decided I had had enough of depending on other people to keep my job, a friend of mine and I opened up our own shop.  Had a logo, motto, mission statement, the whole ball of wax.  Pretty proud of it.  Even though I've since moved on, I kept all the swag like cup holders we made.

One of my best clients early on was a man of Lebanese decent who spoke very little English.  He usually dropped his computer stuff off at my place to have it fixed and then would pick it up the next day.  He had 3 kids and a wife and no matter how much I taught him how to avoid getting viruses he'd keep getting them.  He was very kind and often brought me some of his wifes cooking so I started just doing work for free since he didn't have much money and they were typically quick fixes.

About two months in I get a call from him and he needs me to come over and remove parental controls he had accidentally put on his computer.  He needed me to come as his car was low on gas, he didn't have money to get gas until Friday so he needed to conserve.

I go over and during the course of removing the offending software, his daughter comes and sits next to me.  We had talked about her only briefly and he said that she was studying to be a nurse.  She was absolutely smoking hot, wearing a pretty revealing tank top, short skirt.

She looks early 20's, mabye 22. One thing about me.  I look young.  Very young.  When I shave I look like I'm 20 and I'm 31 now, was 28 at the time.

She asks me about myself, my business, what I'm interested in, stuff of that nature.  I spend more time talking to her then paying attention to the laptop.  There's some pretty obvious chemistry between us.  Eventually she asks me if I have a girlfriend.  I said no, I don't.  She said do I want one.  I said if the right girl comes along.  She smiled and scooted closer to me.

After a couple minutes of sitting there trying my best not to pop a tent I realize that I'm not going to be able to get the computer fixed on the spot.  I'll need a boot CD to remove the software and had left it at home.  I explain it to her, she goes and explains it to her dad.  He nods and asks if I can return it the next day after 4 PM.  I agree.

I spend that night furiously purging myself.

The next day comes and I head on over, repaired laptop in tow.  I knock on the door and the girl answers, impossibly wearing even less then the day before.  She lets me in and I put the laptop back and start to boot it up.  It's then that I notice a book bag on the floor with a bunch of obviously high school text books.  I look at the girl, then back to the bag of books and ask her what grade she's in.

Sophomore.  In High School.  She's 16.  This smoking hot slightly ethnic girl who wants to jump me is 16.  My mind is screaming to get the fuck out of there.  I thank her, decline payment for the repair and leave.
 
Two days later I get another call.  The laptop won't go online. I head over and that's when the girls mother finally introduces herself to me.  She says, ""Ah, this is the man my Carmila goes on about!  You are a fine looking young man indeed!  She is quite stricken by you!""

I smile, thank her for the compliment.  Fixing the laptop only takes me a minute. It's a simple wireless kill switch issue on the laptop.  While confirming that it works now, I notice the girl peeking at me from her bedroom.  She looks at me and licks her lips and makes a 'come hither' gesture with her finger then smiles and closes the door.

I sigh and leave wondering why she couldn't be 18.

A few nights later the girl calls me at round 9 pm. She says the laptop broke again and she needs me to fix it right away for school work.  I summon my best professional integrity and show up.

I take a look at the laptop.  Someone had managed to jam a SD card into the slot the wrong way.

Now, I don't know if any of you know this, but that's pretty hard to do even with a hammer.  She spends a great deal of time showing off her cleavage to me, brushing up against me, touching me.  Her mother is in bed and her dad is at work. I tell her I'm not comfortable with this.  That I think she's very pretty, I admire her ambition but I'm too old for her.

She smiles and nods and sits down nearby and behaves herself.  I fix the laptop and leave.

Two nights later I'm getting milk from Wal-Mart.  It's about 11 PM.  When I get out near my car I notice someone next to my car unable to start it.  She's a fairly old lady and I offer to help her jump her car.  She thanks me profusely.  As we finally get the engine started who should run up to the car?

It's the girl.  I just jump started her grandmothers car.  She hugs me, a little too tightly. She grabs something she shouldn't.  Not wanting to embarrass her in front of her grandmother I disengage, smile and leave.

A few nights later I get a call from her father, Ricky.  He wants to thank me for helping out his mother and for all the free help I've been giving and insists I come over for a home cooked meal.  I decline but he insists.  I really like the guy so I eventually cave and show up.

I show up and breathe a sigh of relief as his daughter is nowhere to be found.  We sit down to eat and after a few minutes the mother shouts that she can come out now.  She's wearing an absolutely gorgeous dress, her hair is done, she was just...man.  I can't even tell you.  It hurts to think about it.  You want to talk jailbait?  I've never felt so uncomfortable in my life.

It's then that her dad asks me if I want to sleep with his daughter.

I nearly choke.

Her mother laughs.  She smiles and says that they really like me and think I would be a good fit for their daughter and want me to date her.  The girl sits next to me and starts rubbing my thigh.  Her mother says that she wants her daughter to lose her virginity.

To me.

My mind can't handle it.  I excuse myself and leave.  The next day her father shows up on my door, upset that I refused but understands why I would hesitate.  Apparently he had spoken with a coworker who had explained the laws of the US to him.  He said that he would not 'get the law involved.  You may have my daughter.'

Anyways...

2 years later the girl got in contact with me again.  She was now legal and wanted me to be with her.  I was engaged to my now wife at the time.  She cried, saying that she had 'stayed pure for me by her fathers will.'

It's been a little over a year now and occasionally I'll get a friend request from her on facebook or a text message asking if I'm still married.

One other thought... if they had run it on second down and failed, you call the time out.  That leaves roughly :22-24 seconds on the clock and gives you time to go to the sideline and discuss BOTH upcoming plays.  3rd down should be a pass, and if incomplete you still have time for a fourth down play, and that fourth down play can be a run or pass.

So there were more ways to get three plays in before time expires other than passing on 2nd down."

Edit, since I've gotten a lot of replies that basically said the same thing about appeasement and freedom of speech:

Here's why this isn't ""appeasement"" and why the alternative is ""trolling"": Google does not regularly publish photos of Mohammed, Jesus, God, or other religious/controversial figures on its homepage. It's offensive to Google's users and its employees, some of whom are religious non-violent Muslims, Christians, and Jews. It would also put those employees in real danger. Choosing to step out of its way to incite others because ""they can"" or whatever absolutely is trolling. It's also going to offend 1 billion people, 99% of whom are not extremist.

What Google has chosen to do instead - publish a [""Je Suis Charlie"" badge](https://www.google.fr/) on its French home page - is far more appropriate, positive, and aligned to its brand. It shows solidarity for the victims and what they stood for without provoking further violence and hatred. Well done, Google."

""I was at the theatres watching 300, and there was this chatty bitch blabbing away on her cell phone, pissing off everyone around. Here in Canada people aren't used to people doing that, and we all tend to be pretty polite and non-confrontational in general so nobody said anything at first. After a minute or so, a guy with down's told her to shut up, at which point she pulled the phone away, turned around and yelled up at him ""shut up, you fucking retard"" and then finished her call... nothing happened after that, except obviously she made an impression on the guy. 

After the movie finished, as everyone's assembling on the stairs to leave the theatre, she was standing in the middle of the stairway facing sideways, talking with a friend. (I never understand why ""friends"" can't tell someone to stop being idiots, isn't it embarassing to them to be seen with these kinds of people?) 

The Down's guy came down the steps, stopped a step or two above her and yelled out: 

This! 

Is! 

Spartaaa! 

And proceeds to lean back and kick her in the chest, causing her to fall down the steps backwards, screaming. 

Lesson? Don't be too mean to retards, because they are *less* likely to be bound by legal considerations."""

**Teddy Roosevelts bad-ass resume:**

* ***Amature boxer while attending Harvard*** (1876-1880)

* ***Deputy Sheiff/Cowboy*** (C. 1885 Badlands, Nebraska) - Hunted down 3 outlaws that stole his riverboat, after caputure Roosevelt guarded the 3 men for 40 hours straight (read Tolstoy to stay awake)

* ***New York City Police Commissioner*** (1895-1897) -Roosevelt implemented regular inspections of firearms and annual physical exams, appointed 1,600 recruits based on their physical and mental qualifications and not on political affiliation, established meritorious service medals, and closed corrupt police hostelries.  Roosevelt made a habit of walking officers' beats late at night and early in the morning to make sure they were on duty.

*  ***Assistant Secretary of the Navy*** (1897-1898) - Roosevelt became Secretary of the Navy for 4 hours while John D. Long went for a message.  He quickly told the Navy worldwide to prepare for war, ordered ammunition and supplies, brought in experts, and went to Congress asking for authority to recruit as many sailors as he wanted.

* ***Colonel Roosevelt*** (1898, San Juan Hill, Cuba) - Roosevelt rode back and forth between rifle pits at the forefront of the advance up Kettle Hill, an advance that he urged in absence of any orders from superiors. He later refered to the battle as **""'the great day of my life""** (Having originally declinded the awarded, in 2001 Roosevelt was awarded Congressional Medal of Honor, becoming the first person to be awarded a nations highest honor for military valor and the Nobel Peace Prize)

* ***President of the United States of America*** (1901-1909) - Held record for most hands shook in a day until 2004 with 8,513.  Regularly boxed as Governor of New York and as President, until his sparing partner detached his left retina, blinding him in that eye.  Occationally skinny dipped in the Potomac River.

* ***Safari*** (1909) - Upon leaving the presidency, Roosevelt went on a Safari.  Roosevelt and his companions killed or trapped more than 11,397 animals.  Of these, their kills included 512 big game animals, including six rare white rhinos. The expedition consumed 262 of the animals. Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to Washington; the quantity was so large that it took years to mount them all, and the Smithsonian shared many duplicate animals with other museums.

* ***Assassination attempt*** (October 14, 1912) - John Schrank shot him, but the bullet lodged in his chest only after penetrating his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech he was carrying in his jacket. Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not completely penetrated the chest wall to his lung, and so declined suggestions he go to the hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his scheduled speech with blood seeping into his shirt. He spoke for 90 minutes. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose."" Afterwards, probes and x-ray showed that the bullet had traversed three inches (76 mm) of tissue and lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle."

Actually, ""embassador"" is an acceptable, though obscure, variant of ""ambassador."" But for a very long time it was the more popular version. Both spellings have been in use since the 14th century (Geoffrey Chaucer actually spelled it as ""embasitour""). Shakespeare used both variations. In the 17th and 18th centuries, ""embassador"" was used much more frequently. But that began to change in the 19th century.

Why? What made ""ambassador"" much more common today?

Starting in the 19th century, editors began tracing the word back to its original etymology—from the medieval French, ""*ambassadeur*"", and ultimately from the Latin ""*ambactus*""—servant. So they began to simplify things, stating that ""ambassador"" was the only acceptable spelling.

**But here is where the plot thickens.**

You see, the corruption from the Latin to the English ""embassador"" occurred among many medieval dialects and had implanted itself quite securely in the English language. So securely, in fact, that ""embassy""—the residence of ""embassadors""—had long been, even in the 19th century, the only acceptable spelling. Or, as Dr. Johnson, authority on English prose, wrote, ""Our authors write almost indiscriminately embassador or ambassador, embassage or ambassage; yet there is scarce an example of ambassy, all concurring to write embassy.""

Thus it was the case that in England, where there were more editors (being more developed than the largely agrarian America), ""ambassador"" became the common spelling, whereas Americans, while still using both, preferred ""embassador"" with the ""e.""

But eventually, the Latin bug caught its way over to America, and American editors now, for the sake of simplification, took note from the Brits and declared that ""ambassador"" is the correct version, being more closely related to the Latin. And thus, ""embassador,"" while still being perfectly correct, went out of style by the beginning of the 20th century.

Thus it is the curious case that in standard English, we have ""embassy,"" ""embassage,"" but ""ambassador."" Cool, huh?"

I can also say an older Brother mine engaged in a life of crime for about 8 years. He started on pills, moved to heroin, and stayed there for about said 8 years. He never really harmed people but did cheat, rob, and steal to get what he wanted. He was involved with a friend and was looking at 25 to life for a bogus kidnapping charge. The woman who was pressing the charges (who owed my Brother's friend money for narcotics) was discredited and the charges were thrown out. Rest assured for about 3 months I really believed I was never going to see my Brother a free man again. This all came to a head when one night after smoking sherm (pcp, wet, whatever) and doing drugs he tried driving home at 7 in the morning. He got hit, tried leaving the scene, ended up at my house with about 9 cop cars in tow. He went to jail the Sunday before Easter and was out Halloween that same year. When he went in he was 198 pounds. When he came out, his skin was shiny, teeth white, smile wide, a healthy 265, and a new sense of purpose in life. He's been clean going on 2 years now, he has 2 jobs, works out everyday, and we both go to school together. I love my Brother more than anything. That being said my Mother deeply blamed herself and my Father who wasn't around during most / all of our childhood. So to compensate when my Mother divorced my Father when my older Brother was 14 she started buying him everything. Designer clothes, shoes, cologne, his first car, all kinds of things to make up for his early life I suppose. This started his ""I can get anything I want"" attitude. He got in a car accident when he was 16 and was given percocet, and that started the monster inside. 

Edit - I should mention my Brother is well over 6'10. Also, I wrote him every 3 days (his preferred times) a letter and we kept in touch through that and phone calls every Sunday night. Since he was big like that, ran a store, and the prison was County and not Federal he was a force on the block. Total Dredrick Tatum moment as he's on the phone, you hear loud commotion in the background, my Bro: ""Yo! Shut up!"" then almost undecipherable whispering afterwards. We had a good laugh about that everytime. Also, prisons rape you on phone calls. They say they need private branch exchanges so they can record and monitor calls, at the end of the day these calls are like $3 to connect, and 75 cents a minute after that, or some outrageous number.

(We know he has a daughter.) I cannot wait to see more of this character next episode... we will definitely be seeing United Republic ships and learning more about Zuko. I need to rewatch to guess the age, but after more speculating I am starting to believe he is a grandson. With Tenzin being a new father at 50, I thought it was possible for Zuko to have an older son, but it is more likely he is just a grandson.

Considering Zuko is still alive with a daughter, it is possible either he helped name his grandson or his daughter named him after Iroh to honor both Iroh and Zuko 

Also, even better, Dante confirmed that this character will be in season 2!!!

They tend to be in the lower socio-economic bracket, but it's quite common to find middle and upper class bogans.

Bogans traditionally wear a uniform of flannel shirts, wife-beaters, track pants, jeans, beer shirts, and thongs. The female bogan, or boguette, will often wear leggings and some kind of low-cut top. Ed Hardy is common.

Bogans are also recognizable by the names they give their children, or bogelings. They **LOVE** to misspell names to make their kid 'unique'. Ava may become Avah, Brandon may become Brandun, Ashley/Ashleigh may become Ashleey/Ashlei. It's popular to give a kid two misspelled names and hyphenate them, eg. Avah-Ashlei.

3503,,,,,162,"your comment makes me wish that I'd focused a little more on the ""answer her questions if its genuine lack of understanding"" part.  I believe most younger women these days can make peace happily with their boyfriend's porn, if they just understand what it's really about.  But like you said, it's not intuitive at all for women to understand that porn doesn't reflect on them, and when a woman has never had her man explain to her that porn isn't about her, it's natural for her first thought to be that the porn means that he's not satisfied with what he's getting, or that he wishes he had something different.  I do wish I'd focused more on telling guys that it's important to help girlfriends understand, before jumping to the putting-your-foot-down part.

Uhm.  I'm a woman, so I'm not sure if I'm the best at explaining this.  What I do know for sure, though, is that porn is not a reflection of your boyfriend's true preferences.  The porn he looks at isn't a good way to measure what his best fantasies are or his true preferences are.  Just because he's looking at a porn star, doesn't mean he actually wishes he was with her instead of you.  She's two dimensional, has no personality or needs or feelings, she is an image that exists for one purpose only - to provide a visual so that he can get off.  He doesn't want her, he doesn't think she was real, he doesn't wish she was real, he just needs a visual image in order to fap effectively.

I guess part of this can be understood in the difference between men and women.  Men are much better able to separate sex and love, than women are.  I'm sure that lots of people are going to jump in and yell at me for stereotyping here, and yeah I know women are capable of enjoying casual sex and that sex can be very emotional for a guy...but stay with me here...sex is more often just sex, no emotional component, for a guy than it is for a girl.  A guy's reaction to sex is ""yes please"" in whatever form it takes, a girl tends to need to be much more picky.  When we see a guy looking at porn, we tend to think that it means to him what it would mean to us - that he's very attached in an emotional way to these fantasies, that these fantasies are meaningful to him.  But, they really aren't.  Sex, especially fantasy porn sex, is just not emotional or meaningful in any way at all.

But your guy loves you, and sex with you IS meaningful, and meets much deeper needs of his than just the need to get off.  You could never be replaced by a meaningless visual that leads to a meaningless orgasm.  That's just coming...but sex with you is emotionally fulfilling in much deeper ways than just the need to come.  When he orgasms, then turns off the porn, at that point the porn he was just looking at is totally forgotten and purged from his mind.  On the other hand, after he's done having sex with you, you will still stay on his mind throughout the day, because he loves you and you mean something to him.

The other key is that men are much more visual than women are.  They somehow need to actually see something sexy, in order to come.  Now if you are like most women, you're imagining something or visualizing something when you masturbate.  Men apparently can't do this, they need an actual image to look at.  Think of porn as being nothing but a tool, much like a vibrator for women.  No value to it except for an aid in getting you off.  

I guess the bottom line is, he really truly doesn't wish he was with the porn star instead of you.  He knows that she's not real, he knows that you are, and even if she was somehow real, you are the one he loves.  Men are just wired towards visuals, but it doesn't reflect on you or what he wants from you in any way at all."

Home ownership rates began deviating from their long term historical averages in the 1990s. This was right when Fannie Mae started owning a huge chunk of the mortgage market.

""In 1992, Congress gave a new affordable housing ""mission"" to Fannie and Freddie, and authorized the Department of Housing and Urban Development to define its scope through regulations.Shortly after these new mandates went into effect, the nation's homeownership rate--which had remained at about 64% since 1982--began to rise, increasing 3.3% from 64.2% in 1994 to 67.5% in 2000 under President Clinton, and an additional 1.7% during the Bush administration, before declining in 2007 to 67.8%. There is no reasonable explanation for this sudden spurt, other than a major change in the standards for granting a mortgage or a large increase in the amount of low-cost funding available for mortgages. The data suggest that it was both.""

 That 5% increase in housing ownership may not seem like a lot but remember to never underestimate how a small shift in supply or demand can shape markets dramatically.

Spanish banks were heavily regulated but that didn't stop a huge housing bubble there either. Spain also had been artificially stimulating housing for years with pro home ownership policies.


 

Spain had a pro home ownership government policy like the US and had +100% home prices. Germany had no housing bubble. Spain was also favorable for foreign investment in housing from places like the US.

Fannie Mae also acted as a world player in stimulating housing because it was such a big share of the world market others had to loosen standards to compete. Fannie Mae dropped Mortgage interest rates by about 1% in America and that had a world wide effect. Just so you know the Value of the $6 trillion in mortgages owned by Fannie is equal to the entire Chinese mortgage market four times over. The entire Chinese mortgage market is valued at $1.6 trillion so Fannie Mae played a larger role in influencing mortgage prices than China, India, the rest of Asia, and sections of Europe combined.

When the private sub prime market took off around 2005 from it's historical average of around 6% to 13% then close to 20% of the market Fannie Mae had already pioneered poor mortgage standards and the banks copied them.

Your computer wants to ask Reddit's computer for the front page.  Imagine that your request is like a person trying to fly from small town Alaska to a small town in florida.

First you go to your tiny airport (your isp) and fly to a larger on in Juno.     It may go like this.

* Tiny airport  (your computer)
* Juno
* San Francisco
* Chicago O'Hare
* Atlanta
* Tiny town in florida. (Reddit)

So San Fran, Chicago and Atlanta are major hub airports.   Like a river which grows from many streams, the traffic flows gathers at the hubs and then out to other locations.  Flights usually involve at least one major hub.  It would be impossilbe to have a flight from your tiny town to every airport on earth.  So instead you take a path to a hub.  Once there, there is a path to all other hubs, thus all other locations.  

It would be just as impossible for you to have a dedicated line from your computer to every single website on the internet.  Internet traffic flows just like the airports.  The core routers are like the major hubs.

Now imagine that Chicago O'Hare closes.  That would be major news and would cause huge ripples through the system.  However you could still get to your destination because you would be ""Routed"" to a different hub, say Salt Lake City and from their you can still get to where you are going, it just took longer because you had to be re-routed.

Now about 30,000 people per day go through O'hare.  Since they are all now being re-routed all of the other hubs get busier.  Another hub may become so busy that they stop accepting flights thus causing even more re-routing to occur.  Now all of the hubs are overloaded so they start canceling flight and putting people in hotels.  In our analogy, these are ""dropped packets"" or ""packet loss"".  

So in the link above, you are seeing three statistics for each router (major hub airport).  Index, response time, and packet loss.   Response time is anologous to delayed flights.   The higher the number the longer it takes for a packet to get to/from the router.  Packet loss represents people put up in hotels due to cancelations.  The router cannot process all of the traffic it is getting so it drops it on the floor.

So you are seeing an airport system where almost half of the major hub airports have canceled ALL flights.  They are dropping everything and the remaining routers are getting all of the load.   This probably happened in a cascade where a couple routers had a problem and the increased burdon on others caused them to also fail.  Like a house of cards toppling.

Luckily the internet traffic is traveling on protocols which can deal with such things.  Just like the airports, eventually the smaller airports would stop sending more airplanes into the cluster fuck until it cleared up.   In the same way the protocols can back-off.  This causes the originating computer (yours and reddit) to detects the packet loss and automatically start slowing down how fast they send data.  This allows such problems to self heal as the traffic on the internet will automatically decrease to roughly fit the capacity.  Then ramp back up again as things return to normal.

It's not perfect but it's fun to know that your computer is taking specific action to help the entire internet deal with such problems.

Perhaps you have heard the phrase ""The internet routes around damage.""   This is true.  You can nuke a router, or a fiber line etc and the traffic will just take another path to its destination.  (it was designed this way partly so it could remain functional in the face of nuclear attack).

Right now the internet in north america is in pretty serious pain.  All the routers, servers and computers are doing everything they can to 'route around the damage' which is why we are still here on reddit.

Hope that helps.

tl;dr That road has a traffic jam, let's go this way.  Alas, everyone going that way causes a new traffic jam.  OR  SHIT O'Hare airport is snowed in."

**For the record**, I don't have a problem with redditors hanging out and talking/voting about posts together. The group seems to have fun and I'm in no position to say they should stop. I'm posting this merely to publicize new information that can already be found, in a summative manner.

Personally, however, I do have a problem if they decided to use their friendship and influence on reddit for profit or personal gain (beyond the discussion or quality of posts), like in the [I_RAPE_CATS debacle](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ggmv3/can_someone_explain_the_whole_april_fools_i_rape/), if the money didn't go to the Red Cross.

I don't know about The Sims, but EA had nothing to do with Spores changes, that's just bullshit. Any game the EA has touched that has been ruined was ruined by the game studios themselves, NOT by EA. You constantly hear gamers complain about big bad EA, but how often do you hear developers complain? 

I recently heard a talk by Karl-Magnus, the CEO of Dice. During the Q&amp;amp;A, when he was inevitably asked about EA, he said they basically just hand out money and let the studio do their thing, and that It was one of the best things that has happened to the AAA industry (and that that's generally how it goes with EA funded games).
Of course that's just an anecdote, but it does reflect the general attitude amongst developers. Tim Schafer doesn't like EA. but where do you think the money to make their Ames would come from in the first place if they didn't happen to have success on kick starter? 

Gamers so often complain about EA ruining their games. They need to wake up and blame the studios themselves for fucking their shit up.
Don't want day one DLC? How about no DLC at all? Don't want an accessible Spore? How about no Spore at all? Those are the choices game studios are faced with. Just be glad that there are a few of them, like Valve, who are not dependent upon all of that monetizing business, but not all studios are so privileged. And you better believe that it's a good thing EA is there to hold their hands when shit the shit hits the fan.

It's not like EA is sitting on a pile of money laughing evily. Where these people think the money that funds their games are coming from? Those money go RIGHT back into the system, supporting studios, keeping them in business.

Don't get me wrong. EA is not necessarily the guardian angel of gaming either, but they're definitely not the ones destroying the game industry. Without big publishers like EA, and without people who where focused on making money, there simply wouldn't be an industry to destroy. You can't have your cake and eat it to.


*edit:* I can clearly tell I'm in a gaming subreddit and not a game development subreddit. If you don't agree with what I'm saying, that's fine, but please at least try and do some research into game funding, and WHY compromises are taken to bring you your favorite games."

I used GNU/Linux in 2000-2004 for every day jobs, but eventually went back to Windows XP because it just did all those things equally good or better like gaming. And because I didn't really want to even be associated with Linux users because... well, let's just say they think they are on a mission and sound like it.

I tried it again later last year and while it was a lot better (Crunchbang and Mint), unfortunately so is Windows 7. So I went back to Windows 7.

Weddings are common sources of stories, both true and fictional.  Furthermore, weddings often feature a character who serves as either ""the third wheel"" or ""the interloper,"" either interrupting or attempting to interrupt the love story taking place.  Upon opening this thread, did you expect to see a story in which the pastor served as ""that which comes between""?  How do you find this to fit within the typical narrative of a love story, in which the three elements are the lover, the beloved, and that which comes between?  Like many examples of the interloper, the pastor probably considers himself to be ""the beloved.""  How would the ending of the story change if this were the case?

1. "". . . the U.S. is unique. And just as we have the world's most advanced economy, military, and technology, we also have its most advanced oligarchy.

    In a primitive political system, power is transmitted through violence, or the threat of violence: military coups, private militias, and so on. In a less primitive system more typical of emerging markets, power is transmitted via money: bribes, kickbacks, and offshore bank accounts. Although lobbying and campaign contributions certainly play major roles in the American political system, old-fashioned corruption--envelopes stuffed with $100 bills--is probably a sideshow today, Jack Abramoff notwithstanding.

    Instead, the American financial industry gained political power by amassing a kind of cultural capital--a belief system. Once, perhaps, what was good for General Motors was good for the country. Over the past decade, the attitude took hold that what was good for Wall Street was good for the country. The banking-and-securities industry has become one of the top contributors to political campaigns, but at the peak of its influence, it did not have to buy favors the way, for example, the tobacco companies or military contractors might have to. Instead, it benefited from the fact that Washington insiders already believed that large financial institutions and free-flowing capital markets were crucial to America's position in the world. . . .""

3. "". . . With the notable exception of the War of 1812, the United States did not face any significant foreign incursions in the 19th century. It contained the threat from both Canada and Mexico with a minimum of disruption to American life and in so doing ended the risk of local military conflicts with other countries. North America was viewed as a remarkably safe place.

    Even the American Civil War did not disrupt this belief. The massive industrial and demographic imbalance between North and South meant that the war's outcome was never in doubt. The North's population was four times the size of the population of free Southerners while its industrial base was 10 times that of the South. As soon as the North's military strategy started to leverage those advantages the South was crushed. Additionally, most of the settlers of the Midwest and West Coast were from the North (Southern settlers moved into what would become Texas and New Mexico), so the dominant American culture was only strengthened by the limits placed on the South during Reconstruction.

    As a result, life for this dominant 'Northern' culture got measurably better every single year for more than five generations. Americans became convinced that such a state of affairs -- that things can, will and should improve every day -- was normal. Americans came to believe that their wealth and security is a result of a Manifest Destiny that reflects something different about Americans compared to the rest of humanity. The sense is that Americans are somehow better -- destined for greatness -- rather than simply being very lucky to live where they do. It is an unbalanced and inaccurate belief, but it is at the root of American mania and arrogance. . . .""

4061,,,,,125.0,"&gt;without being explicitly gay

As someone who includes this genre of porn in his fap arsenal, I can say with confidence that people still will call you gay for it. Except gay people.  My brother calls me a faggot for watching it, and I say, ""Ha ha. Sure dude. Whatever.""

It's a kink. That's all it is. I think it probably has different draws for different people. I see threads on 4chan where people are looking at guys who are simply dressed in women's clothing. This does nothing for me. I like them to look as feminine as possible-- whether they're regular women, trannies, robots, or crocodiles. If it's generally shaped like a woman, I will have an urge to fuck it. Period. 

I think you would see a similar market if there were porn that had normal women with a third hand instead of a vagina, or maybe a toaster made of flesh. It's just something different, you know?

I don't think it's a closet gay thing, or a bisexual thing, or anything like that (at least, I know it isn't for me). I can try to fap to a picture of a man, but it doesn't work. It doesn't turn me on. I mean, it's a dude. Where are the curves? Where are the tits? Ah, there they are, on that beautiful creature over there. My brain doesn't give a fuck that there's a package between her legs. If the pattern recognition were that strict, girls with deformities of any kind would never mate. We are programmed to be attracted to things that generally look like women. If you look at a reasonably convincing tranny and *aren't* turned on, then maybe you're the one who needs to come out. The social stigma and personal fear associated with falling under that stigma prevents people from experiencing that attraction directly, but it's there somewhere.

It's biology, friends. 


**edit:** Someone actually anonymously gave me three months Reddit Gold for this post. That was a very kind gesture, and I appreciate it immensely. Whenever I preach on this subject, I feel like I'm addressing a massive frustration. So many perfectly normal, straight guys have to deal with personal and social anxiety over their sexual identity. I know it's comforting to hear, ""It's okay, bro. It's totally not gay,"" but I would also like to emphasize that *even if it were*, there would be no problem with that. 

The sexual dichotomy, just like separate bathrooms for men and women, is a social construct. If we could get rid of the bigotry, misinformation, and general bullshit, then sex would just be sex. It's something people do because it feels good and brings us closer emotionally. It satisfies urges that are *not* socially constructed-- urges that we can only superficially control. If everyone understood this, we wouldn't have to read the news every other day about some kid killing himself because insecure, bigoted assholes at school bullied him to death over what amounts (or should amount) to a virtually inconsequential difference.

It's about freeing minds. Not just about sex, but about everything. The sooner humanity clears its collective mind from the demons of bigotry, ignorance, greed, narcissism, and  superstition, the sooner we can lay down our guns, nooses, and Molotov cocktails. Once this happens, we can all travel to the stars as one big family. "

Its sad but reading garfield anthologies obsessively was the only thing that made me feel normal and it eventually took on something of an erotic fixation.

To avoid feeling like a sicko I drew pictures of garfield with a womans(Think Pamela anderson circa 1991) body and garfields head, so that I was assured that my fixation wasn't with animals or repressed homosexuality. This garfield/pam hybrid still had the same biting wit and acerbic outlook and tended to cut herself in self loathing while wolfing down a lasagna to fill the void after sleeping with drawings of a much more handsome and muscular version of myself. These drawings eventually evolved into erotic fanfiction starring garfield and myself (In my head Garfield still has a womans body but someone reading the stories would think Im having sex with regular Garfield.) I killed off Jon in a jealous rage, I didn't touch Odie, I enjoy his companionship and don't mind if he watches.

The stories are your pretty basic wish fulfillment stuff, balanced with self loathing rants. I've been doing this near daily for years and I have a substantial amount of writing in a folder I keep buried in 8 different folders.

My girlfriend stumbled across them by accident when they came up in a search and is pretty freaked out. How can I show her I'm just a normal guy with a weird outlet for my psychological problems and not some kind of sicko?

Here is a small sample so you get the picture.

I looked at her as she lay on the floor crying, my satisfied cock dripped droplets of life juice on her toes, flaccid yet still distended, looking satisfied like a man who has just run a mile and is rewarding himself with a slice of pie.

She reached for the knife as she always did and sliced into her familiar wound, mumbling 'i hate you, i hate you'. Its your own worthless soul you hate, god hates us all and thats why he laughs, he created the world to laugh at our pain, now eat up! I kicked her in the stomach incapacitating her and as she doubled over forced a pan of lasagna down her stupid throat, she coughed most of it up but I made her lick up every last drop as she cried the tears of an empty soul I found my cock get hard from her pain and went for her ***, rubbing her blood gushing forearm into her stupid face.

Odie looked at me with a look of fear mingled with hatred but he new not to interfere, and I could tell by his doggie hardon that he didn't truly mind, she would suck him off later he knew for my amusement. I made her suck many people off, to gain friends in the community but mostly to humiliate her and destroy any self esteem she had left."

Yeah, the dude was lazy with his performances and used beat repeat and a crappy Ableton set up (who didn't know this?). He plays with CDJs nowadays like most other EDM performers.

As for this bullocks about him not really producing anything, and that there's this super secret league-of-evil-esque sound design teams that do everything ... is this guy actually serious? Or did he forget to take his meds?

There's numerous interviews with Skrillex about his production processes. The guy knows what he is talking about. This post is bad and you should feel bad.

Has this guy actually ever done any music production? For one, Skrillex doesn't have a bank of ""samples"" he uses over and over. They're called patches. Number two, getting given a bunch of patches and some drum loops and throwing them together *does not* give you a decent track, especially not something of the level that Skrillex releases.

edit: Since Everseer wants me to support my arguments, because apparently the image does this ""alot"" more than I do, here's a list of shit wrong with this theory:

**12th Planet** - Established and pretty respected artist who Sonny Moore lived with for awhile. They're very tight. You really think that someone so knowledgable would never notice something was up? You never think 12th Planet has been in the studio with Skrillex? That he has never seen Skrillex actually produce? Come on.

**Interviews** - There are quite a few interviews with Skrillex about his production process. He doesn't go in-depth and give a step-by-step tutorial on how he gets his sounds (who does?) but for ANYONE with even the slightest knowledge of music production can read over these and verify that yes he does know what he's talking about. This is one http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/interview-skrillex-on-ableton-live-plug-ins-production-and-more-510973

**Integrity of poster** - The guy claims to have ""many years Ableton experience"" but can't tell the difference between a sample and a synth patch. Right.

**Inconsistencies** - So in the last section of this guy's rant he goes on about how Skrillex supposedly kept a few of the growl patches and now doesn't use anything else because he can't make anything else, but then goes on to complain that Skrillex's newer tracks no longer have those growls, and thus is somehow proof that it was someone else making them. That doesn't even make sense.

**First of the Year** - ""This track is the last we would ever hear of the noises that got Skrillex so highly regarded"". lolwut? Are you serious? He's put out lots of new tracks that have been well received. Oh they don't use the exact same noise as he used to, and that's proof that he's a fraud? The guy relies too heavily on one sound and gets ripped on as a one trick pony, so he moves into altered sounds and now he's a fraud? 

There are zero facts in this clusterfuck of tinfoil hats and autism. I will concede that yes, he has a point on the performance factor. Skrillex was (and still is sometimes) a horridly lazy live performer. The rest of the post is absolute hogwash.

My dad thought it would be ""fun"" to stay in a 400 year old stone cabin in the middle of fucking nowhere, Europe. We (my dad, mom, myself and my best friend) left the small town we were visiting and drove for about 20 minutes through farm fields, never meeting another car or person. We eventually reached a forest, and drove down a dirt road for another ten minutes. After that, the road ended, and we walked another ten minutes down a small path to the cabin. The forest was dark and dead quiet: not a bird, or a squirrel, or anything. Total. Silence. 

The cabin had been renovated for basic necessities. There was a single lightbulb in the ""main room"" (consisting of a small table with a bench, a rocking chair, and a cast iron stove). There were two small bedrooms with old fashioned beds. There was also some ""creepy"" stuff, like those old polished mirrors, a rocking chair, an old crib, etc. Not creepy by themselves, but in that setting, yeah.

The first thing we noticed is that the door didn't lock - it didn't even close, because it was warped from age. I immediately insisted we leave, but my dad, mother, and friend blew me off, saying it was no big deal - we were in the middle of nowhere, anyway. I checked all our cell phones for a connection, but even my dad's ""international"" phone had nothing. 

It soon became dark - like, really, really dark. We were sitting around the table playing cards when an old man opened the door and walked into the cabin. He was tall, thin, and wearing a suit (really weird, since we were in a poor farm village). We all jumped up, terrified, but he said he ""wanted to say hi and see how we're doing"", in perfect English (also weird). My dad asked who he was, and he said he was a neighbour from down the road. We're like, ""Um, what road?"" and he said he lived in a farm a few miles down and wanted to know if we'd come over for dinner. It was like 10pm. My dad said no, we were fine, but the guy was pretty insistent we come over. Eventually, after much refusal, he told us where he lived and said to ""come over if we needed him"". He then opened the door and walked down the path out of view.

We were all a little weirded out, so my dad dragged the fire-poker-holder and put it in front of the door to ""lock"" it. Eventually we went went to bed: my dad took one bedroom, and my mom, friend and I took the other bedroom. I refused to sleep or turn off the light, clutching a small flashlight I had brought on the trip.

About 2am, a slight breeze picked up, ruffling the trees outside. The door started tapping, opening and closing slightly with the breeze. I was totally freaked, but kept quiet, trying to convince myself that a breeze could pick up in a deep forest. 

Then my mother woke up SCREAMING. Out of all of us, she was the least freaked out by the cabin, because she grew up in a small log cabin with no water/electricity. I kept trying to settle her but she was trembling and shaking. My dad came running in and comforted her. Eventually she said that she'd had a bad dream, but couldn't remember it, and everyone went back to bed. 

About an hour later, the light went out. Total darkness, and so quiet my ears were ringing - the wind had stopped. I went hysterical, crying and sobbing. I turned on the flashlight, but it was flickering on and off. My dad once again came running into the bedroom to comfort me. After about ten minutes, the light flicked back on. By then, I was basically whimpering in the fetal position.

My parents were trying to comfort me, saying lights go off all the time in Europe, when my dad's cell phone rang in the other room. We all froze. My dad went to answer it, and it was my grandmother from back in Canada. She was worried, and wanted to know if I was okay. 

Here's the weird thing: my grandmother had a bad stroke in 2000. She can't walk, can barely talk, forgot how to use all technology, and can't remember me or my mother. She sort of has a vague idea of who I am, but that's about it. Her caretaker then took over the phone call, terrified, saying my grandmother was laying on the floor with the phone and must have crawled to it (out of her room, down the hall to the kitchen, where the only phone is).

Now my dad was totally freaked out, too. After he hung up, he tried to call my cousins. No connection.

We all basically sat in the main room for the rest of the night. Something very large kept scrabbling across the roof, the door kept blowing open - once it actually slammed open, knocking over the poker-thing and rocking the rocking chair, to my utter terror - and weird tapping sounds kept occurring. As soon as daylight came, we walked to the car and drove to my cousins house. 

My cousins weren't remotely surprised to see us, saying everyone knew that place was haunted, and they thought that's what why we wanted to stay there. My mother quietly explained that her ""bad dream"" that night was an old man and woman living in the house, but she couldn't remember what was so terrifying about that. We asked about the man in the suit, but my cousins had no idea who we were talking about - the town only has like 200 people.

When we came back to Canada, my grandmother had no memory of calling us - not surprising, though, since her short-term memory is bad. We told her about the trip, and when we got to the cabin part, she was like, ""Wait, is this the old cabin in the forest off so-and-so road?"". When my dad said yes, she started to yell how foolish we were. 

She then explained that ""everyone knew"" that the Devil lived in the house, and had killed an old man and woman hundreds of years ago, using their bodies to wander around. Even when the Russians burned down all the villages, they refused to burn the cabin down because they were so terrified of it.

Yep.

***tl;dr***: Stayed in a creepy haunted cabin in the middle of nowhere. Weird shit happened. Read last paragraph for result.

&gt; LabView

My understanding of LabView applications is that it makes transforms of audio or electronic signals fairly easy. Audio processing is not, however, a terrifically complicated problem -- plenty of highly reliable software on this problem domain has been written in algorithmic languages.

I haven't seen an office suite written in LabView. If there is one, and it's bug-free, or significantly more bug-free than other suites, please point me to it.

&gt; The fundamental claim of Project COSA is that reliability is not necessarily inversely proportional to complexity even though this is true for the algorithmic software model

Again, please tell me why this claim is valid. The only reason i was able to find boiled down to ""algorithmic software is manifestly more buggy than hardware"", which is little more than an argument by [appeal to belief](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-belief.html).

&gt; It is true that a UTM, being a sequential process, cannot be used to implement a true real-time parallel system. By definition!

Is this software expected to run on a Von Neumann architecture? If so, then i assure you that a UTM can model it. If not, then you aren't taking issue with the software process, but with the way computers work from the hardware on up. If you have a worthwhile alternative to Von Neumann architectures, then please write it up and offer it to the community.

What my issue comes down to is this: i see no mathematical difference between the system you are proposing and the system that is currently in place. If you could explain the difference in those terms, then please do.

Until then, if you can show me software of significant complexity written with this system, and prove that it's less buggy, then i'll reconsider it. For this purposes, significant complexity means user-facing software which does more than simple mathematical transforms. I offered an office suite as an example, but i'd accept, say, a web browser, or even a typesetting system that arrives with fewer bugs than TeX.

In February 2009, their office in Brisbane, Australia was shut down. In November 2009, Electronic Arts cut a total of 1500 jobs which affected various studios, including a complete shutdown of Pandemic. On November 17, 2009, EA officially confirmed Pandemic Studios' closure, laying off 228 employees. EA absorbed 35 Pandemic employees to support The Saboteur and an unannounced project which was later revealed to be Mercs Inc, a sequel to the Mercenaries series.

""Inalienable rights"" refers to a concept from the Declaration of Independence, that in turn is based on Locke's concept of natural rights. Those are explicitly life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ""Inalienable"" doesn't mean they can't be taken away; it means they cannot be made alien. Everyone will always desire those things.

Due process is a right that arises from the laws of man, not of nature. You are not born entitled to a jury of your peers or the right of non self incrimination by nature. This comes from society and the state that protects it.

Also, since football is played in bursts with highly specialized positions and formations, it is extremely tactical. The skill of coaches and players being able to reading the other team's intentions is placed on a premium compared to other sports.

Baseball is also the most technical sport. Throwing, catching and hitting are skills that are 90% finesse/training, 10% physical ability. As a child of Korean-American immigrants I grew up playing all three. Soccer is my favorite sport out of the three, but I still love football and baseball. "

Yes, amateurs often rail at the claims other amateurs make.  You'll never see a respectable, experienced CS geek say much about OO, because it's mildly useful, and not that big a deal.

When someone discovers a silver bullet, they're a highschool sophomore, and you shouldn't be listening to them.  That does not, however, reflect poorly on the thing they're talking about.

You aren't heretical: you're part of the five year backlash at the fad from five years ago.  In two years there'll be another you being ""heretical"" that Ruby is kind of lame, and that domain specific languages aren't that big a deal.  Another year or two out, and another you will discover that Haskell just isn't that important, and that for all their usage of the largest words they can find, they aren't really all that smart.  Design patterns are also being berated by ""heretics"" (amateurs) who listened to other amateurs claiming they were Jesus Juice, then still couldn't finish their projects, and assumed that meant that the Jesus Juice, rather than they themselves, were the failure.

A year after that, and several people will scientifically determine that the functional languages that we started with in the 1950s, moved past in the 1960s, and that everyone fell in love with in 2007, aren't actually higher expression or lower defect, and were moved past for a reason.  After that it'll be the cloud, then APIs, then SOAP.  XML every three years.

Et cetera.

This is nothing new.  You've unearthed the vague, boring stupidity of your recent, novice peers.

Thanks for announcing your heresy on the stuff that the rest of us had worked out in the 1960s.

Read a book.

&gt; When I raise these points I often get the answer: You can't write really large applications without OOP. I haven't been involved in the development of multi-million line applications

Neither have the people you're asking.

&gt; These are giant multi-million SLOC projects that don't use OOP and continue to improve every day.

Hilariously, one of the germinating reasons for BSD was to move to object oriented principles; the Unix Way is deeply object oriented; Linux is firmly object oriented; Windows has been object oriented for more than 16 years now both in design and in the languages used; et cetera.  All three of your examples are built on completely false assumptions that show that you know either very little about OOP, about the three projects you named, or most likely, both.

Please stop pretending to know what you're talking about.  You're just giving some idiot five years from now a reason to ""be heretical"" and discover that OOP actually is a pretty decent tool.

&gt; Then there's the problem of the object relational impedence missmatch.

Beanie hat, barbeque-sauce stained t-shirt and knee pads.

I don't know whether it's funnier that you used that phrase without knowing what it means, or that you can't spell 50% of the words in that phrase.

Ah, so if you've only ever seen bad object oriented code, I can see how in turn you would think you know enough about OOP to comment on its utility.

Similarly, since I've never been to Spain, let me tell you about its people.

&gt; So if I'm wrong, why am I wrong?

Not enough disk space on reddit, but basically:

1) You don't know what you're talking about
2) Your examples are based on wrong, made-up data
3) You're dropping big phrases to sound smart
4) You're arguing with positions no respectable engineer has ever taken
5) You've never done any of this stuff yourself
6) You assume the reason you're having difficulty is ""all the levels of indirection"", when having all those levels of indirection is a classical sign of someone misusing tools because they heard it was the OOP way to go about it
7) You've never used the phrase ""I don't know""
8) You build arguments about things you openly admit you haven't done, don't know about and have never seen done well
9) You apparently don't understand that #8 is why you shouldn't have been speaking in the first place
10) You appear to be waiting for someone to sit down and counter-prove a bunch of life examples that you haven't made available for counter-proof, which are generally of the form ""mine was hard to work with and I never saw anyone else do it well""

The best part is that you probably can't actually name a large application that isn't object oriented.  The worst part is that you assume things aren't object oriented because nobody ever said they were and you cannot imagine not knowing a thing, so you're just going to rattle off a list of other large products and assume they're also not OO.

&gt; What am I missing?

Almost everything, really.

&gt; From where I am sat,

From where you sat, you don't do it well, you don't know what projects do, you've never seen it done well, you don't know what it's for, and you can't imagine why that isn't a reason to not pretend to be an expert on the topic.

&gt;This ""potential discovery of the Higgs"" is anything but I'm afraid. I've had a read of the paper, and there are a few things that are important to note here.

&gt;1: It's an ATLAS COM note, which is meant to be internal to the ATLAS experiment and has absolutely _no_ peer review. Anyone in ATLAS can write a note like this, and it could be total bullshit. The next stage in the process is to write an internal note, which is put under somewhat more scrutiny by the collaboration prior to turning it into a publication if it's considered good enough to do so

&gt;2: The person heading up this note, Ms. Wu, is famous both inside and outside ATLAS for spamming vast amounts of notes out in the hope that one of them will be of some merit. She's hell-bent on finding the Higgs in the way that Rubbia was in finding the W boson back in the day. Sometimes people sacrifice good physics for the desire to get the prize. She ""found"" the Higgs at the LEP experiment at 115GeV in the gamma gamma channel as well, but this discovery was ruled out then too.

&gt;3: The analysis is flaky to say the least- they don't model the background at all, and merely fit to the distribution shape. In QCD backgrounds are very important. That bump could come from anywhere, either a detector, trigger or physical effect arising from a background distribution they don't understand

&gt;4: If the bump genuinely is a particle, it is _NOT_ a standard model Higgs. They find about 30 events in the peak, which with the data we have now is much too many to be a Higgs- it would mean the number of Higgs produced is about a factor of 10 or more larger than the Standard Model allows for. We'd have seen it in the US Tevatron experiments, and maybe even at LEP if it was produced as copiously as this. What it _could_ be is something new and non-standard model. If it is that's amazing, but again it's hard to imagine something that only appears at LHC energies and not at those of the tevatron in such copious amounts

&gt;5: This has caused a massive shitstorm in ATLAS because internally everyone knows it's shit, but it leaked within about 10 minutes of being circulated internally and the press/bloggers have jumped on it like it's evidence that god exists, elvis has returned from his trip to mars, and flying pigs use antigravity to get around.

&gt;The party line from the experiment is ""This is not an official ATLAS publication"". The general feeling is that the backgrounds need to be understood, the analysis needs monte-carlo simulation to back it up, and that the group who produced these results should have put a lot more effort into the publication before spamming it and claiming ""first post"".

&gt;I should put a huge disclaimer here: I'm not a member of the ALTAS collaboration, though I do work at CERN. My speciality is not Higgs physics, so my understanding of this only comes from a general particle physics background. Any opinion I express here is my own and not for republication."

&gt;Hah, I'm lying if I were to say it wouldn't be hot if she were to magically able to grow a penis and let me jerk her off then it disappears when she cums. I'm not gay but I feel that an erect penis is the best sign someone is aroused, how hot would it be to meet her or a girl you have a crush on and she blushes and pops a huge boner and has to cover it up with her purse and you can tell the pressure of holding it down with her purse is making her even more aroused.

&gt;THANK YOU, yes I did find two girls 1 cup disgusting. As you can tell what I am attracted to is the struggle and subsequent relief not scat itself. The struggle was entirely lacking in 2g1c, it was obvious the girls took laxatives and stool softeners beforehand cause it came out like soft serve ice cream. The ideal bowel movement for me to watch would be ones where the stool takes a ""comet"" formation wherein the bulk of the mass and roughage is located in a large ball at the front that they have to struggle and stretch out their anus to pass and the rest erotically wriggles out like a rubbery/slimey snake. It would be incredible to be able to have a slo-mo tape of a girls contorting struggling and finally relieved elated face as the comet head passes and the snake wriggles out. Anyone who has watched the end of a sybian video where the girl cums sighs, laughs, and staggers around rubber legged knows what I am getting at. Right now the only thing close to scat porn I watch are analacrobats.com type videos, that use bouncy balls and rubber spiky nerf type balls etc. Most scat vids give you disgusting closeup views of her anus as the shit comes out, I don't wanna see that. They really should make movies where neon colored hot cake batterish bags of paste (with chopped peanuts for roughage) are emptied into a girls anus and left to congeal and she then has to force it out and rub it all over herself. (She would take a pre video colonic to ensure no actual scat) My ideal video would be a lesbian orgy vid where a girl has a pound or two of skittles funneled into her ass which she then shits into another girls asshole (the other girl gaped herself with a huge buttplug) who then shits it into another girl, etc. etc. I'm thinking Lexi Belle, Bree Olsen, Sasha Grey, Stoya, Gianna Michaels, Faye Regan, Chapel Waste, Aurora Snow, Alexis Love, Tanner Mayes and Jenna Haze. Of course they are all oiled up as well."

Pretty sure this will get buried in the comments, but I'm a divorce attorney. I would suggest you contact a lawyer licensed to practice in your state. You're getting a lot of bad advice on what to do on this thread, and you really should present your concerns to someone who knows what they're talking about. 

**Edit:** 

**Wow. I guess it didn’t get buried. After reading some of the below comments, I thought I come back and address some of them.** 

I understand that the OP came here to vent, not for advice on a divorce. However, a lot of the comments seem to go in that direction. I hope that for the OP and his family’s sake that this is just a simple misunderstanding and everything will be cool after he and his wife address this issue. I believe that the best course of action is for the OP (or anyone faced with this kind of situation) to talk about it with his wife. Not only is civil communication the key for making any relationship work, it’s also very important to an amicable divorce (should the situation devolve into one). One of the things that I try to make all my clients with children understand is that divorces only rearrange families, they don’t actually dissolve families. Even after the divorce, the parents will still have to maintain a functioning relationship for the sake of their children.

Next, to the legal issues: Let me begin by saying that I am most likely not licensed to practice in your state. Nor do I know all the facts relevant to the OP's current situation. This is not legal advice. However, I have noticed some comments that, if followed, could get the OP into trouble down the road. Here are some issues to keep in mind and discuss with an attorney:

1. The most important thing I think the OP needs to understand is that most, if not all, states have privacy laws. I imagine that the thing that OP wants most right now is definite proof, one way or another, as to whether his wife has committed adultery. OP should either discuss ways to get proof of this with an attorney or a licensed private investigator. If OP goes off half-cocked playing Sherlock Holmes, not only may any evidence he gathers be inadmissible in court, but he may also inadvertently commit a crime or a tort (money damages). DON’T HACK INTO ANY OF HER ACCOUNTS!!! In my state, it’s a crime to look at someone’s account without their permission, even if they left it open.

2. The other most important thing is to be extremely careful about moving your assets. You should not do this at all without consulting an attorney, an accountant, or someone of the sort who is licensed in your state. I believe that the comments are suggesting (and the reason OP may want do it) that this should be done as a preventative measure. However, I cannot stress enough that this needs to be done in the proper legal manner! Otherwise, you can get yourself in really deep shit down the road. 

3. Don’t listen to anyone saying that you should kick your wife out of the house until you talk to an attorney and find out if and how you can do so legally. Illegally evicting someone from their home may be a crime and may leave you liable for money damages.   

4. Don’t take your kids away or refuse to let your wife see them. Not only would doing this be used as unfavorable evidence in a custody hearing/trial, but it may also be a crime in your state. Also, only assholes do this.

5. Don’t talk shit about your wife around your kids. Don’t try to be their favorite by making her look bad. If you do it may be used as evidence against you in any custody hearings. Remember: THE KIDS ARE NOT WEAPONS TO USE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER!!! Again, only assholes do this. 

6. Document everything! Keep a diary of everything that occurs between you and your wife (unless it makes you look bad). Preserve the text message and any documentation that proves that you were out of town when whoever it was stayed the night. 

7. Kind of related to the last one: Despite what the others say, Adultery MAY actually be relevant even if your state is a no fault state. My state is a “no fault” state, but evidence of adultery is admissible to block alimony when the adultery was the cause of the separation. Also, it may be relevant to custody if the kids were in the home at the time the adultery occurred. 

Finally: TALK TO A LAWYER! Even if you don’t go through with a divorce, a licensed attorney in your state will be able to advise you of the best course of action. A lot of attorneys do a free consultation or an initial consultation for a couple of hundred bucks. 

**TL;DR My ultimate advice to the OP: Talk about this with your wife openly and honestly. Even if she hasn't cheated on you, your suspicions will eat away at you and pollute the marriage. Secrets destroy marriages.**"

Monolayer graphene (one sheet) has quite different properties to bilayer graphene (two coupled sheets).

Trilayer graphene has also been looked at; depending on the stacking variation (ABC or ABA), its electronic properties are like a monolayer and bilayer combined.

The more layers you have, obviously the closer you come to having physics that is well understood, that is physics of graphite."
18690,,,,,35.0,"&gt;You're at the store, standing in front of the potato chip display. Which bag do you buy? I know you're not checking the price on each. You have a favorite. A preference.

Actually, I usually try to buy something that I haven't tried before.  Yes, I have a preference, but that preference is based on a large sampling of similar products, not on the brand.

And yes, I **do** check the price.  Half the time, I end up buying whatever is on sale.  Store-brand potato chips on BOGO?  Score!

&gt;Don't try to act ""superior"" because ""marketing doesn't work on [me].""

1. It was not my intention to come across as ""acting superior"".
2. Marketing has less impact on me than on the average person simply by nature of the fact that I am exposed to almost no marketing.  Here's another place where I'll likely be accused of ""acting superior"", but I no longer watch normal TV, so I'm not exposed to commercials.  Further, I use AdBlock when browsing the web, so I'm spared web ads, too.  The result is that I'm just not marketed to to the same degree as the ""average person"".

&gt;Choosing products based on the product itself is exactly what brand loyalty is

Huh?  Choosing products based on the **brand** would be brand loyalty.  Choosing product based on the **product itself** is kind of the opposite of brand loyalty.

&gt;Somewhere along the line, one soda brand ran an ad to make you think their product is superior.

Negative.  I judge soda based on taste (and sometimes price).  I have preferences based on flavor, not on brand, which is why I frequently purchase generic soda.  It tastes about the same, and costs way less.

&gt;You're not superior, you're not smarter, STFU and go home.

What are you, some kind of marketer who is insulted that his marketing tactics don't significantly influence all people?"

His tastebuds will change temporarily. I suddenly thought many things were very bitter. Coffee, my number one staple drink, I couldn't even touch or smell for some time. Beer, tea, anything with a 'bitter' taste, was awful. I couldn't stomach it. A lot of food also changed in taste for me. I lost my appetite and quickly lost weight. Don't bug him about eating, but maybe offer him something once in awhile. Sweets even if you have to. My doctor actually told me eat junk food, or anything -- pints of hagen daz, snickers, whatever, just to keep my weight up. Maybe buy some of that 'for yourself' but let him know he's free to take some. I found sweets were much more appealing than a lot of normal food during my 'strange tastebuds' phase. Smells can also be funny. Some people apprently smell food and lose their appetite for it for a very long time after cancer because they got sick from the smell. So just be aware about cooking really odorous foods.

**EDIT:** about the weird, persistent taste he might experience. Sometimes people call it 'metallic' but it's more like...not sure. But not cool. -- I found pickles knocked that shit out. Biting into a lime or lemon helps too momentarily, but no, eat a damn pickle. 100x better effect. 
 



**=======VERY IMPORTANT BIT ABOUT NEUTROPENIA=======**

Make sure a thermometer is in the apartment. If his temperature goes too high, some doctors say 100.5, some say 101.0, then he should call the doctor or head straight to urgent care. This is if he has [Neutropenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia), which is a condition of lacking your neutrophils, which are the white blood cells that fight off infections. I don't know what cancer he has, but this is a possibility from either the cancer itself or the chemo treatments. A very simple infection that you might fight off can be fatal for him. His body has NO WAY to fight it off. Thats why a tempertature of 100.5 or 101, which may be a *'oh I need to lay down in bed for the day'* for you, is a *'I need to go to the hospital NOW before this escalates'* for him. They will hook him up to an IV with saline. The influx of fluids will help regulate body temperature, and they will probably give him a course of antibiotics, possibly something strong like cipro to make sure they get whatever is causing the fever. 
 


Neutropenia was my absolute BANE during chemo. Chemo regiments destroy your immune system. As I said, I had non-hodgkins lymphoma, which is a cancer of the immune system, so this exacerbated the issue for me. (Severe is ANC &lt; 500, I was at &lt; 40 twice). Both times I got that low, I spent a week in the hospital on heavy antibiotics and under very close watch. 



I was also neutropenic (but not at those record lows) almost every 2nd week after treatment. I had a treatment once every three weeks, and the first week I was generally OK (or slowly getting worse) and then the **7th-14th days I felt like I had the flu and had to sleep a LOT. Don't bug him too much, let him get his sleep if he needs it.** Remind him to take his temperature to be safe if he's neglecting it and has been neutropenic before.



Basically if he becomes neutropenic the most important thing is just **BE CLEAN. VERY VERY CLEAN.** Dishes, everything, etc. Remember to clean up after yourself. Be careful about pets, especially outdoor ones. If you have a cat, don't let it come indoors and drag dead birds/mice presents for you. Not cool. Also be careful about having a lot of people over. The most people that visit and carry germs in that they've been picking up throughout the day, the more risk the interaction carries. So if you want to see friends it might be better to go out to see them and let your buddy be, unless you friends are willing to take a good hot shower and clean up before coming over.



Invite him out on his good days, but seriously let him be on his bad days. Especially if he's neutropenic. Let him be, don't risk him getting sick or eating bad food. It's not worth the hospital stay and the bills.

**=======END OF VERY IMPORTANT BIT ABOUT NEUTROPENIA=======**



He may vomit. He should get prescribed anti-nausea medication for it though. He may get diarrhea or stuff like that. He might need moist wipes but be unable to get them and afraid to ask for them. (some of the rougher chemo aren't too friendly with your insides. Dropping a deuce is a unfamiliar pain).



**HE NEEDS TO STAY HYDRATED. DO BUG HIM about that. IT's MORE IMPORTANT THAN EATING.** Particularly if he has a large tumor. As the chemo breaks down the growth, his body has to process not only the chemo drugs out of his system, but the tumor as well. This is rough on the kidneys and liver. Staying hydrated will help prevent kidney failure, kidney stones, and other complications. If he becomes a recluse and doesn't get out of his room or whatever to eat much, maybe suggest he at least keeps drinks nearby at all times so its not 'effort' to drink water. **Don't 'tempt' him with liquor or beer, its just more stress on his organs, and he's already processing more hardcore shit than shitty pbr.** A beer or two is okay, but really, don't push it at all. It's not worth it. I currently as I type this have 8 bottles of water, 2 gatorades, 3 vitamin waters, and an orange juice at my desk that I drink and then replace constantly throughout the day. 



*(Remember I just finished my chemo, so I still have 3 weeks of 'recovery' from my last treatment. That means this one week I will be crashing, 7th day to 14th neutropenia, and then a third week of my immune system building itself back up.)* 



The hair loss thing is a big deal for some. I thought it was funny and proceeded to pull chunks of my hair out. It was fascinating. Wait to see how he reacts and then just go with the flow on that one. Buy him a hat or something as a gesture would probably be nice even if he decides to not wear them.  You could buzz/shave your head too, A few of my friends and my younger brother did that. It was nice, but a bit weird getting used to as well.



Depending on the type of guy he is, he might bitch about the pain of the blood draws etc. Humor him. I didn't have much trouble with this stuff, but while I've been getting my shots I've seen some grown men be VERY childish about getting certain shots. I will say at first I hated the blood draws, my first experience was a vasovagal and I nearly fainted because of anxienty of the needle in the crook of my arm. I got used to it quick though. He might have bone marrow biopsies which they stick a pretty big needle into your hip, crunch the bone inward with force, and then you experience a very odd tearing and suction of your bone marrow. Some people find this pretty painful. Anyway, the point is, he might be complaining about things like that, or he might not. Either way he's bound to experience some unpleasant crap that you just need to be aware of. He might be in a shitty mood from some of it, or he may take it all pretty well. That's up to you to find out as his roommate and act on. 



**If you got a separate toilet, use it.** For the first couple days after chemo, **he's very toxic, and urine, feces, etc is pretty dangerous for you.** Same with his clothes if he's sweating on them. He does his own wash. No mixed washes. 

Buy Lysol wipes, good cleaning stuff materials and gloves, and make sure the bathroom is clean for your own safety if you only have one bathroom. 
 

Anyway, for the most part I suppose I just gave you health issues to be aware of. But I hope it helps. As far as your attitude goes, just be yourself. Show some concern, but don't smother him in it. Let him know you can help out however he needs and to not be afraid to ask for anything. His attitude about the issue will be how you have to base your attitude on it. He may want to ignore the issue and 'be normal' he may want to tell you everything and like some sympathy. 



He'll appreciate your offer and if he decides he needs it, he'll ask for it if he's the type. If he is more of the 'I'm okay type' you might have to use your judgement. Out of all of this though, I sincerely hope you take the neutropenia section to heart.

By and large, if you go to a private school in Australia, you are white and wealthy.

There is a culture of objectification of women and mateship - both of which eventually create a culture of exclusive clubs (see the Melbourne club and the Athenaeum) and discrimination (seen in the above video).

So, Tim (because it's that mother fucker's name), left and when I looked for my money it wasn't there. I called him to ask if he'd seen me place it somewhere else, whatever. Benefit of the doubt and all that. He has no idea.

Well, the more I think about it, the more I'm sure he took it because there's just nothing else that could have happened. So I call a girlfriend, we get in my car and drive over to his mom's, which is where he lived. She had no idea where he was but when I asked if he'd ever stolen money before she just sighed really deeply and asked how much. I told her that it was over 2000 dollars, money for my education. So she searched her whole house including all his ""favorite places"". Like in the toilet tank. She tells me he's on probation and has to be home at a certain time, which was the first I'd heard about it.

So friend and I talk about it and we decided to wait at the house until he gets there and confront him. He's with a friend, gets out of the car and we start arguing in the street, with him insisting he knows nothing about it. I'm getting more and more pissed, starting to threaten to call the cops and stuff. Just as things are starting to get heated, another car drives down the street and stops very suddenly in front of his house.

These two chicks get out and I hear Tim say ""oh shit"". This girl with 2 inch deep black eyeliner, homemade tatoos and a mohawk walk over to me and says, ""Hi, I'm Tim's girlfriend. Who are you?"".  I'm getting worried at this point because I'm not a fighter at all and I know she could beat my ass if she wanted to.  So I opt for the truth. I tell her that I've been seeing Tim and that I think he's stolen my money.

Tim is about 10 feet away from us; he's been kind of inching towards the house. She turns away from me, walks right up to him, punches him in the face as hard as she can, turns around, gets in the car with her friend and leaves.  I found out later through a mutual friend that they had met at rehab and that he had told her she was the love of his life or some shit. She'd gotten out of rehab *that fucking day*. 

So he's standing there with a bloody nose and I tell him to give me the money now, or I'll call the cops. So he pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and tells me he's already spent 60 of it on pool and beer, but I'm happy to get that much back and just ask him why he would do something like that to me. He says ""because I could"". 

And I don't see him again until many years later when I'm working at a coffee shop and he comes in with another girl that was sort of in my group in HS. I give her the very short version of the story and find out he's done time, has been to rehab several times, has kids with god knows who...but he's changed and she loves him!  I didn't even try to talk her out of it. I figured she'll learn soon enough. 

Seriously, though, I'm really glad I had that experience at 19. It's saved me a lot of heartache by teaching me not to give my trust to anyone that hasn't earned it.  I am very careful now."
1340,"Gaming media sites had no problem writing articles speculating on the Emily or Brad Wardell stories that contained alleged sexual misconduct, but discussion of Zoe Quinn's affairs were completely ignored and discussion was expunged and moderated out (might even call it censorship).","Gaming media sites had no problem writing articles speculating on the Greg or Brad Wardell stories that contained alleged sexual misconduct, but discussion of Zoe Quinn's affairs were completely ignored and discussion was expunged and moderated out (might even call it censorship).","Gaming media sites had no problem writing articles speculating on the Jamal or Brad Wardell stories that contained alleged sexual misconduct, but discussion of Zoe Quinn's affairs were completely ignored and discussion was expunged and moderated out (might even call it censorship).","Gaming media sites had no problem writing articles speculating on the Lakisha or Brad Wardell stories that contained alleged sexual misconduct, but discussion of Zoe Quinn's affairs were completely ignored and discussion was expunged and moderated out (might even call it censorship).",-10,"When GamerGate first started, a lot of different things happened very quickly. 

First, there was the outrage about Zoe Quinn getting preferencial treatment in the media when the Zoe post came out, presumably because she was a woman. Gaming media sites had no problem writing articles speculating on the Max Tempkin or Brad Wardell stories that contained alleged sexual misconduct, but discussion of Zoe Quinn's affairs were completely ignored and discussion was expunged and moderated out (might even call it censorship).

So at first GamerGate was upset with the media basically for being sexist; they did not hold Zoe Quinn to the same standards as the men they would report on. Instead they gave her a free pass and did their best to cover the whole thing up. And a lot of Gamers raged about it, in very threatening ways. They demanded that this injustice was proof of corruption, and they made their voices heard. GamerGate would eventually come around to the idea that it was not because Zoe was a woman that she was getting prferencial treatment - she was on the inside of a larger clique in gaming journalism. It wasn't some kind of misguided sexist double-standard (although some argue this was a motivating factor), it was just plain nepotism. We can see this in the leaked GameJournoPros emails where a few big names in the journalism scene got together to give her an aid package. And there is evidence of collusion in things like the IGF.

But by then the damage was done. The gameing media formulated its response and decried the GamerGate crusade as inherently sexist. Every major gaming publication came out with the infamous 'Gamers are dead' articles. Obviously this was not to say that gamers were dead, but that the ""old gamers"" (white, sexist males who were entitled and used to having things their way) were being replaced by a more diverse, more ""good"" type of gamer (an influx of progressive female and minority voices). It wasn't that game sites were unethical or had sexist double standards or even colluded with one another; it was that ""old, bad gamers"" were just mad that they were dying out and being replaced.

What this has done is create a divide between ""good gamers"" and ""bad gamers,"" and so GG is basically a label to throw onto the ""bad"" gamers. You can see this in the other reply to your post by /u/GatePleb, who talks about ""the good side of gaming in Zoe and Anita.""

I don't think GamerGate is the only thing at fault for the negative media portrayl of gamers; there were numerous stories before GamerGate of how gaming, and by extension gamers, were part of a sexist culture. Anitas first video was before GamerGate, gamers unhappy with ME3's ending were labled entitled babies, Dragon's Crown's Sorceress art had a lot of ""this kind of art is sexist, dont buy this game"" discussion (even though the game was actually quite good), and God of War Acension was docked points by Adam Sessler for the achievement ""Bros before Ho's"" as evidence of misogyny in gaming. The #1reasonwhy campaign. And the Max Tempkin and Brad Wardell stories of course. The list could go on, and all of these helped create the narrative that ""old"" gaming was rife with sexism and misogyny. A lot of gamers were already upset by these stories, which would lead to GamerGate being so explosive.

So who do we blame for the division in gamers? GamerGate for accussing major game sites having some kind of double-standard regarding sexism and nepotism (which they call a lack of ethics), or game sites for branding the ""old gamers"" as white male sexists (which is really just not true)? The way I see it, there's some truth to both of those things.

I begged and begged and then finally my father took me shopping for the perfect mouse. I named him basil and he was a cute little fucker. But poor little basil needed lots and lots of play time which I couldn't give. So I bought him a female friend. He became a rapist over night. And would like to chew on her ears. So I thought to myself. Maybe another mouse will help. So in goes another female the following weekend. I let two female mice get repeatedly raped by (this time he was obese and lazy, except when he got his little mouse hard on) Alpha Mouse. Confused and angry at him. He didnt listen to me nor did he stop. So I managed to get my father to buy me a big ass fish tank. Maybe two metres in length, one metre high. And separated the tank with two inch thick cardboard. Too late, they were pregnant. Anyway, a couple weeks later I had too many baby mice (fuck they jump high!) and Mr Basil chewed his way through the cardboard and was a shitty father to the baby mice. I didn't want them to get pregnant as well... 

I got home from school one Friday afternoon and I noticed my catholic family of mice were all gone! Except for basil, he even had the whole fish tank to himself. My mother gave me around $30 and said that she sold them all to the pet shop for $1 each. I was stoked. First of all, I had $30 and second, they were all going to go to lovely homes.

Fast forward twelve years: It was Christmas and we were laughing at the time I hand delivered 28 odd baby mice, and my lovely mother dropped the bomb that she had put them all in the freezer to die.

Last night I saw this story briefly, in a title only. It said something 'bizarre theft of pagan statue' or something. So we can see the media is treating it as a joke since the title should have mentioned the note or the cross put in its place. Carberry is completely correct- this is very much a hate crime, and nobody is treating it as such. I hope the issue is taken seriously so whoever is responsible might realize they aren't untouchable just because they're Christian. "

To help understand that one you can try dividing 1 by 3 by hand (i.e. long division) and you'll see how there is no way that this sequence will ever end.  Pi is the ratio between a circle's circumference to its diameter and it is non-repeating and according to wikipedia non-ending.  Understanding how pi is non-ending is a bit more complicated but it can be understood through the proof that pi is irrational.  Based on Lambert's proof that pi is irrational (see the wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational), it can be shown that pi can be expressed as a never ending series and therefore it itself is a never ending number.

Every 3 or four days this would be substituted for two hardboiled eggs and a bananna. Lunch- normally about what I would eat for breakfast nowadays, some soggy veggies and a sandwich. Supper--- oooh the big one, usually about the size of a normal lunch. Lunch and dinner also came with a 3 inch square cake most days. I fucking starved, they expect you to buy more food from canteen. One guy I was with was allergic to the chemical they put in turkey which makes up all the kinds of ""meat"", he went for two weeks only getting cheese and peanut butter sandwiches substituted for every meal.

I can't see how any of those investments really matter. They are just handing money to Universities and not demanding results and then the Universities pocket the money, fail to produce results and raise tuition. 

There is just not coherent plan here. Handing out grants is nice, but cutting millions off from education because they can no longer afford tuition kind of ruins the whole idea of handing out more grants.

A more realistic approach would be to work on lowering tuition costs not funnel huge sums of money to colleges and corporations. 

Well of course Bush isn't anti science, but his investments are mostly stupid when you go actually look at them one by one. More importantly they are all just token investments not meant to ever produce anything. 

Do you understand? He is appeasing the need for science grants, but he has no plan nor is he asking for any real return. It's just money being thrown around without a vision.

In a time like this we don't need random science investments. We need a path to follow to lower energy costs and lower health care costs. We need sciences that specifically lower costs, increase production and focus dramatically on efficiency. 

But what we are getting is robotic drones and transport trucks, inferior body army, and vast underinvestment in alternative energy to keep up the guise of progress.

But cmon, Bush is a oil man, he isn't going to commit in any way that changes the paradigm of profit. He'll push useless military tech which we'll never see a dime from. He'll make wide investments guaranteed to produce few results. His investments are unfocused and random because they are not goal oriented, they are favor oriented.

On the right side of the track there is a single railroad worker, Lakisha, who will definitely be killed if the brain steers the trolley to the right.",36.0,"Consider the following case:

On Twin Earth, a brain in a vat is at the wheel of a runaway trolley. There are only two options that the brain can take: the right side of the fork in the track or the left side of the fork. There is no way in sight of derailing or stopping the trolley and the brain is aware of this, for the brain knows trolleys. The brain is causally hooked up to the trolley such that the brain can determine the course which the trolley will take.

On the right side of the track there is a single railroad worker, Jones, who will definitely be killed if the brain steers the trolley to the right. If the railman on the right lives, he will go on to kill five men for the sake of killing them, but in doing so will inadvertently save the lives of thirty orphans (one of the five men he will kill is planning to destroy a bridge that the orphans' bus will be crossing later that night). One of the orphans that will be killed would have grown up to become a tyrant who would make good utilitarian men do bad things. Another of the orphans would grow up to become G.E.M. Anscombe, while a third would invent the pop-top can.

If the brain in the vat chooses the left side of the track, the trolley will definitely hit and kill a railman on the left side of the track, ""Leftie"" and will hit and destroy ten beating hearts on the track that could (and would) have been transplanted into ten patients in the local hospital that will die without donor hearts. These are the only hearts available, and the brain is aware of this, for the brain knows hearts. If the railman on the left side of the track lives, he too will kill five men, in fact the same five that the railman on the right would kill. However, ""Leftie"" will kill the five as an unintended consequence of saving ten men: he will inadvertently kill the five men rushing the ten hearts to the local hospital for transplantation. A further result of ""Leftie's"" act would be that the busload of orphans will be spared. Among the five men killed by ""Leftie"" are both the man responsible for putting the brain at the controls of the trolley, and the author of this example. If the ten hearts and ""Leftie"" are killed by the trolley, the ten prospective heart-transplant patients will die and their kidneys will be used to save the lives of twenty kidney-transplant patients, one of whom will grow up to cure cancer, and one of whom will grow up to be Hitler. There are other kidneys and dialysis machines available, however the brain does not know kidneys, and this is not a factor.

Assume that the brain's choice, whatever it turns out to be, will serve as an example to other brains-in-vats and so the effects of his decision will be amplified. Also assume that if the brain chooses the right side of the fork, an unjust war free of war crimes will ensue, while if the brain chooses the left fork, a just war fraught with war crimes will result. Furthermore, there is an intermittently active Cartesian demon deceiving the brain in such a manner that the brain is never sure if it is being deceived.

Obama is announced to the podium, and a musical montage set to Hulk Hogan's ""Real American,"" and full of stereotypically American pictures (bald eagles, the long form birth certificate, Michael Jordan, Transformers) plays him in. Obama welcomes everyone and mentions the release of his long form birth certificate. He states that he's also going to go a step further and release his birth video. The video plays, and it's the opening scene from *The Lion King.* Everyone laughs, and Obama makes it clear to the FOX table that the video was a joke, and if they don't believe him, ask Disney because they have the long form. 

Obama talks about how he's too professorial, and comments on how even movie stars (his biggest constituents) are disappointed in him. He singles out Matt Damon, who recently said how he was disappointed in his work. Obama then says, ""Well I just saw *The Adjustment Bureau,* so right back at you."" (paraphrased)

The President then thanks his wife and mentions that they make a great team. Just last week at the White House Easter egg roll, he was passing out bags of candy and she was snatching them back. Obama then makes a quip at NPR and asks, ""You guys are still here?"" He continues to joke about the future of NPR by discussing possible new programming, like ""No Things Considered,"" or ""Wait Wait, Don't Fund Me.""

He continues discussing the deficit and Paul Ryan, who is absent because he is busy working on his budget, which has no room for laughter. However, Michelle Bachman is present, and Obama quips that her presidential aspirations may be in danger because she was born in Canada. He says, ""Yes Michelle, this is how it starts."" He continues by joking about other GOP presidential hopefuls by saying that Tim Pawlenty's real middle name is ""Hosni,"" (after Hosni Mubarak), and that former ambassador Jon Huntsman didn't learn Chinese to go to China, but learned English to come to America.

Obama goes on with the GOP presidential candidate jokes, discussing the, ""vicious rumor,"" that Mitt Romney passed universal healthcare while he was governor of MA, and that Donald Trump should investigate. He really rips into Donald Trump at this point by saying Donald's glad the birth certificate issue is over so he can go back to things that matter, such as, ""Did we fake the moon landing,"" or, ""What really happened at Roswell,"" or, ""Where are Biggie and Tupac?"" 

He also discusses the Donald's experience by talking about a recent episode of *Celebrity Apprentice* where the men's cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks because of a lack of leadership, and fired Gary Busey. These are the kind of decisions that would keep Obama up at night. The President also thinks Trump would bring change to the White House and the camera pans to the screen, showing the White House photoshopped to look like a gaudy casino.

Obama then says it was a wonderful year, especially in film, and praises *The King's Speech.* He claims there is a sequel in the works and plays a trailer about how he cannot give a speech without a teleprompter. The trailer goes on and shows how Joe Biden teaches Obama how to speak without one, albeit with horrific results. The title of this fictitious film is, ""The Presidents' Speech.""

Obama then closes by saluting the men and women overseas, as well as the plight of the people of disaster-stricken Alabama. He tells the audience to keep those Americans in our thoughts and prayers, and that we must help them as much as possible. He says he believes the journalists will do their part in this task as well. He credits the amazing things journalists have done around the world and the danger they are constantly in, praising them for their hard work.

    
TLDR: Obama tells some funny jokes and gets serious at the end. Also, rosebud."

This accounts for a compute cluster to be disabled, akin to the GTX 480, to keep clock speeds up.

AMD on the other hand is rumored only to be going for a 25% increase in shaders.

Efficiency wise, AMD and Nvidia are a lot closer right now than people credit. Comparing the performance and power of the 7870 and the 680 reveals they're very close. (Like against like, the 7870 and 680 both have gimped double precision FP and run around 1GHz)

With these big chips, I think TDP is going to be the limiting factor. The simple matter is running a big chip at a lower frequency is more efficient than a small chip, fast. AMD is getting in a rut of cranking up the clock speed. It's good for their bottom line, but it's unsustainable.

The only way I see AMD coming out the victor is if they actually had the confidence to make a big GPU. They seemed to have abandoned the 7990, so it's not unreasonable to speculate that they may follow the road Nvidia takes and create massive chips.

Does the fact that you believe in the US as a force for good mean that you are an evil person? No, just like quiet rural practitioners of Islam are no more dangerous or evil than Buddhist monks.

I was jogging around an outdoor track, enjoying the serenity of a run absent of hills and valleys.  Chen and Karen preferred scenery when we ran, but back in my old life I used to enjoy the mindlessness of a perfectly boring manmade track-and-field course.  Running without thought was as close to meditation as I’ve ever experienced.

We were all in great shape now.  I was on my third mile and feeling no pain.  In the distance I heard the hum of our generator powering the biology lab’s centrifuge and god knows what else.

In my head there was nothing but thoughts of steady breathing, and the pacing of footfalls.  I could feel my heart pumping, my muscles tensing and relaxing, my joints flexing, and the sweat dripping.  For a moment I was not an orphan, a survivor, or a damned soul; I was just machine turning its gears.

It was in this moment of perfect serenity that I heard the voice.  “Hello,” it said.

Startled, I spun my head to see where the voice might have come from.  I lost my footing and tumbled onto the asphalt.  I braced my fall with my forearms, and felt the burn of skinned flesh.  Searing pain exploded from my wrist.

I rolled onto my back, folding my wounded limbs to my chest.  I breathed shallowly through clenched teeth, feeling wave after wave of pain shoot through my body.  I looked around for the source of the voice but there wasn’t a sign of life in any direction for at least a hundred meters.

The pain in my arms and wrist began to subside to a manageable level.  I pondered my next move.  Cleaning the wounds seemed like a good idea.  Although they probably couldn’t become infected, they would become inflamed if any sizable foreign matter wasn’t removed.

As I stood, I realized that my right knee was also quite bloody, and sore when I put weight on it.  I began limping towards the biology lab, then thought the better of it.  If there was any bacteria on this planet that *could* give me an infection, it was probably up there in a lab with my friends.  I changed course and headed for the health services building.

“Hello,” the voice said again.  “We need your help.”

I spun around again, and seeing nothing, brushed my hands to my ears reflexively- though I couldn’t think exactly what I expected that to accomplish.  My pulse was racing now.  Something was wrong.

When I’d heard the voice moments ago on the track, I assumed it was the sort of hallucination one has when they’ve been quite sleep deprived.  It was a brief, transient thing- something to laugh about later.  But *this*?  A complete sentence, just moments later?  This was no small thing.

I tried to enter the health center but found the doors locked.  This was a rare experience at public buildings because of the timing of the… incident.  The health center must have kept bad hours.

I smashed the window with a rock, and reached in to turn the handle.  I made my way to an exam room in the near-dark.  There were no corpses in here- a nice change of pace.

I found some non-stinging disinfecting fluid and some gauze.  I wondered if my cuts could be infected by my own bacteria living on my skin.  I didn’t want to find out.

I bandaged my arms and knee carefully.  The voice said, “We need your help.  You must find us.”

I screamed a stream of nonsense babble in an attempt to drown the voice out.  I stumbled as fast as I could, back to my friends in the lab.  When I was nearly to the door of the science building I heard the voice again “We need your help.  You must find us.”

I was losing my mind.  I limped up the stairs to biology lab, my heart racing with fear and panic.  I threw open the double-doors to the lab.

Karen was perched on the edge of one of the work tables: shirt on, jeans and underwear crumpled on the floor beneath her.  Chen was between her legs, similarly attired.  His back was to me, and he was thrusting into her wildly.

Karen’s bare legs were wrapped around him, and her hands clawed at his back.  Their grunts and moans filled the room over the sound of a spinning centrifuge.   I stood for a moment in stunned silence. 

Karen’s eyes were squeezed tightly closed in an ecstatic spasm.  I stumbled backwards out of the room, but one half of the double-door had already closed.  In my haste to leave I slammed into it with my face.  It made a terrible banging sound, and I squeezed my eyes shut in pain.  I tumbled backward into the hallway and landed against the far wall, sliding down to the floor and gripping my wounded face, with my wounded hand.

Before I had time to pity myself, I heard the voice again, “We need your help.  You must find us.”

I stood and ran awkwardly down the hallway to the stairwell.  I half ran- half fell down the stairs, and kept going until was outside in the open, stale air.  I fell to my knees on what used to be a grassy lawn.  I started heaving violently, unsure if I was vomiting or sobbing.  Blood streamed down my face from the gash I’d just given myself.

“We need your help.  You must find us.”

I threw my hands over my ears and curled up into a ball on the earth.  I shut my eyes and started rocking myself to distract from the pain in my body, and the panic in my mind.

I didn’t notice when Karen flew outside through the doors and ran over to me.  I was startled moment’s later when I felt her hand on my shoulder.  I looked up at her, and saw the pity in her eyes.  She thought I was having a fit out of jealousy.

When she saw the blood on my face and the terror in my eyes, her expression changed.  She screamed for Chen.  When I saw my fear reflected in her, it was too much.  I wasn’t sobbing exactly, but my throat was tight and I was breathing in harsh, raspy breaths.

When Karen asked me what was wrong, I was unable to speak.  As I tried to calm myself and form the words, I heard it again. 

“We need your help. You must find us. There isn’t much time.”

Irrespective has a similar meaning and similar sound to regardless, and the blending occurs when a speaker mistakenly applies the prefix from one to the other. It's a common error for the uneducated/inarticulate. They then go on to use irregardless to mean the same thing as irrespective or regardless, which is **an error**. This is why they state: 

**""Its reputation has not risen over the years, and it is still a long way from general acceptance. Use regardless instead.""**

That seems pretty unequivocal to me.

There is, and a very good one, even using conventional economics: if you can borrow at 2% and lend or generate 4% returns, then you should do so indefinitely, and there is no sane reason to ever pay down debt or stop taking on more of it. 

So-called ""neo-chartalists"" would take this a step further, and basically recommend that Barack Obama resolve the debt by ordering the treasury to mint a $15tn platinum coin, and deposit it in the treasury, or some such. Viola, zero debt. This is both legally and technically possible, and would, in fact and practice, bring the treasury balance back to zero. And it's not just nutjobs arguing for it. See here for more on other ""heterodox economics"", including the Austrian school, and the not-too outlandish ideas of so-called ""Market Monetary Theory"", which holds that central bankers should not distinguish between real growth and inflationary growth:

http://www.economist.com/node/21542174 

If your only econ education comes via internet forums, you might think that there are two ""schools"" of economics, ""Austrian"" and ""Keynesian"". In truth, ""Keynesian"" is not really a ""school"", it's what fringe economists accuse mainstream economists of being. 

John Maynard Keynes contributed a lot of ideas to econ, but the big one that sticks in the craw of so-called ""Austrian"" or ""classical"" economists is the notion that government deficit-spending can boost economic activity. This is absolutely, 100%, uncontested mainstream economics-- no fortune 1,000 company would ever hire a senior economist who did not believe that government spending could impact economic growth. There is no ""school of thought"" dispute on this point: right or wrong, what Austrians call ""Keynesian"" is mainstream, and everything else is fringe or heterodox. Economists do not call themselves ""keynesian economists"" any more than physicists call themselves ""Eisenstein"" physicists. That's something you get accused of being, by people who want to imply a sense of parity with non-mainstream ideas. 

If you only know econ from internet debates, you might think that ""Keynesian"" is some kind of liberal theory of social justice or something, but it's not. It's a baked-in-the-cake component of mainstream economics that says that governments have the ability to stimulate economic growth through spending. 

Without taking a position on the rightness or wrongness, it is fair to say that ""keynsian"" is mainstream econ, and those who reject it run the gamut from heterodox to ""fringe"". 

Back to the point...

- From a mainstream, ""Keynesian"" POV, there is no reason to ever pay off debt, the only consideration is to keep GDP growth higher than debt growth and inflation, long-term, so that the payments are sustainable. 

- From a MMT POV (which is still fringe, but which follows orthodox econ), it's not even necessary to worry about inflation, all that matters is to grow the nominal GDP, and the rest will follow. 

- From a neo-chartalist POV, all this worry about debts and deficits is much ado about nothing. Money is a pure abstraction, representing the good faith and credit of the USA, and if it ever becomes a problem, you can just mint trillion-dollar platinum (or copper) coins, whatever. 

- The Austrian POV (bracing for downvotes) is something like a ""real value"" notion of money, wherein gov't debt or monetary policy can only, at best, fuel bubbles based on too-easy credit or investment capital. A pure ""Austrian"" or ""classical"" economist essentially rejects monetary policy and regards all econ as a system of individual barter transactions or value-exchanges. From the ""austrian"" POV, there is little or nothing that fiscal or monetary policy can do except impede or distort the real economy. It is often tied up with libertarian ideologies, but they are separate things. 

Of the above, it is perhaps only the ""Austrian"" school that would argue against deficit-spending into a recession, and then only the most die-hard followers who would actually argue that deficit-reduction would lead to faster economic growth.

I'm disappointed that we didn't get a proper answer about the overbalancing of bosses, but hopefully the update on that topic will confirm some type of fix, cause right now they have completely missed the mark.

The main thing though is that their logic and reasoning behind all the changes they made make sense to me, even if the end result wasn't implemented as smoothly as possible. This gives me hope because it does seem like they actually know what they are doing, which I was really starting to question. They just need to tune the changes they are making in game better.

1) They gave solid reasoning for their opinions and admitted they may have overtuned the bosses / champion ratios, which I'm hoping will result in bosses being toned back once again because how it was before seemed perfect with the new drop rates (as long as they buff 60+ item drops..).

This is probably one of my biggest areas of contention with them though. Why the hell do they have this image in their head of what will make the game the most fun? Did they ever stop to ask the players what they wanted? Personally before this patch I was killing 8 elites + 2 bosses in a great fast run which had a lot of variety and felt FUN. After the patch it is now impossible to do Cydea as a ranged, and i'm reduced to warping around the map being bored searching for random champions. I really don't see how their vision is good for the game. If people want to do runs then they should be allowed to play as they want. They really don't have a clue what made Diablo 2 farming fun in my opinion, which is a major stumbling block in their design along with the itemization in general.

2) I think NV works perfectly as it is right now, and doesn't need changed. I agree with their reasoning here and really hope they don't cave in to community pressure concerning more important issues which this seems to be riding on the back of.

3) I don't agree that the IAS nerf was a big deal. I do think it could have been handled slightly better / not nerfed as harshly though. At the end of the day moving and attacking fast is a major fun factor in the game, and removing that seems like a bad move overall. They should have perhaps buffed base attack speed on all classes, but lowered damage so that base DPS remained the same. Then they could have cut the **itemization** of AS by 50% like they have now, but still kept the fun factor of attacking quickly. It's probably not as simple as that due to how things scale etc, but off the top of my head some workaround like that would have been better.

Most people complaining about this seem to be piggybacking off the issue of spending a lot of gold to buy IAS items and them now being worthless. Which is annoying I agree, I personally was in the same boat but I realize that IAS was severely over budgeted and had to be changed.. you just have to grin and bear it sometimes.

I don't buy the issue of people buying IAS items on the RMAH and those items now being worthless though. The devs had already stated that would  be nerfing IAS before the RMAH was up, investing money into items at that time is just your own stupidity.


4) This is just tuning. It's expected. I do think they should have hotfixed WD's though.

5) I'm happy they are going to be adding items back to breakables. It was always a nice suprise to find something nice in a pot. However people are blowing this issue way out of proportion imo, breaking pots isn't good gameplay, it's a minor part of the game which is 'nice' to have, having it being an option for getting the majority of your loot just encourages botters and is generally bad for gameplay.

6) Stats could definitely do with a rework.

7) Can't really comment on this, I wasn't really affected  by the issue.

8) The repair changes were ~~RIDICULOUS, and need to be reverted asap~~ perhaps over-balanced. I laughed at people saying Blizzard were forcing you to use the AH before this change, but now it is undeniable. There is simply no way to get enough gold to cover repair costs during normal play. We should not be forced to sell items on the AH in order to repair. I'm tired of going on about this issue, but it was a terrible decision and removes a lot of freedom and fun from the game.

**edit**: I admit I probably over exaggerated on this point due to the frustration I was having with Cydea, and lumped the repairs from that into the argument in my head. It isn't as drastic as I first felt, however I still think it needs tweaking so that it discourages death without being prohibitive to gameplay other than farming, removing the general wear and tear could bring it back into balance so i'll wait and see.  

I'd like to thank everyone for their interesting and thought out replies though, I can be a bit ragey at times and it's refreshing to have an actual discussion the way things have been lately.

9) - 

10) Already mentioned this before, disappointed that they didn't provide a response, this is a huge issue and i'm looking forward to reading the response. Hopefully they don't ""forget"" about this question.

Overall i'm still unhappy after 1.03, and will be taking a break untill the drop rates are buffed again. I will still enjoy the game i'm sure, but like most people I have the nagging feeling that this game should have been so much more. This gives me hope that after a lot of changes (or perhaps an expansion) the game will be fit to rival D2 though."

22983,,,,,687.0,"When I graduated high school I went to college and got my certificate to be an EMT. I did this so I would have a job to help pay for school while I studied to be a nurse. The first call I ever got (to go out into the field on an ambulance) will haunt me for the rest of my life. A 4 year old girl with severe cerebral palsy rolled over in her sleep and was unable to roll back. She suffocated. We got the call and loaded ourselves up to go. When we got there the most heartbreaking scene unfolded before me. The grandfather was sitting in his wheelchair, tears slowly falling. He just stared straight ahead the entire time we were there. The mother kept running back to the little girl's room (the little girl was laying on the floor in the living room so we could have room to work) and she would grab a stuffed animal and run back into the living room. She kept saying this like ""Baby, you have to wake up for Bun-Bun! Wake up Baby! Do you want Froggybottom? I'll get him for you! Wake up Baby! Please wake up!"" I can still remember every name of every stuffed creature she brought to her baby. The thing is, her baby had died during the night and had been dead for hours. Most people don't know that CPR has about a 5% chance of actually helping you. If have been dead for any significant length of time, you might as well not even try. I know it sounds horrible but the fact is it simply won't do anything at that point. Doesn't mean we didn't try. Doesn't mean we don't always try. You never know who will be in the 5%, so you have to try. The family needed us to try. So for 45 long minutes, we tried. We tried everything we could try. Towards the end, the mother disappeared into the little girl's bedroom and didn't come back. We finally pronounced and we're making arrangements for the coroner to come when I decided for some stupid reason to go get the mother. I shouldn't have done that. She was tearing apart the girl's room frantically searching for something. ""Ma'am, we need you to come into the living room."" ""I just have to find her Kitty. It's named Snugglebutt and I just know that's what she is waiting for! Help me! "" ""ma'am, I'm so sorry, but we need you to come into the living room...."" I had no idea what to say. Should I tell her we pronounced? Do I tell her the coroner will have some questions for you? I was young and inexperienced and had no clue what my next words should be. So I said nothing. I moved into the room and began searching with her. About 5-10 minutes later the ambulance crew I was training with came into the room. They kindly explained everything to her. The stupid thing is, the entire time they talked to her and comforted her, I kept searching for that damn stuffed cat. I guess I felt that since I couldn't help her in any other capacity I might as well find this stuffed animal for her. I found it in the back of the girl's closet under a pile of clothes. The mother was an absolute wreck and eventually we sedated her after a consult with our Medical Director. The entire ride there was in absolute silence save for the light sobs by the mother. We dropped her off at the ER and explained everything to the staff. We cleaned out our ride, refilled supplies we had used and headed out to another call. To this day I still get up 4 times a night to check to make sure everyone in the house is breathing. My husband, daughter and even the pets get checked every single night. I have trouble letting our little girl spend the night with anyone but us because I can't check on her if she isn't home. I went on to get my first degree in Emergency Medicine and became a Paramedic, then continued my education to get a degree as an RN. I have worked I the medical field for years and have seen a lot of life and death in my time, but I cannot forget the ones who were beyond our help. I know it's not healthy but I can't let them go. Don't get me wrong, I have made peace with death and what comes with it. I know I am not to blame for these people's passing, but the thought of letting go of them entirely is simply something I cannot do. Every new patient I get reminds me that we can be here one minute and gone the next. I wonder every now and again what happened to that family. I hope they are doing well and are at peace. 

TL;DR: first call as a newbie EMT was a dead four year old whose mother do not take it well. It's fucked me up. "

Nope.  I consider weight lifters to be athletes even though they don't necessarily have endurance or speed in running.  

&gt;Think about something like volleyball or basketball, yes, each player has to have some amount of baseline physical fitness (a high baseline, but whatever), but just being more ""athletic"" than the next guy is not gonna help you in the slightest. It is about skill at the game, not who can run the fastest around the basketball court.

If it's more about skill than athletic ability than it probably shouldn't be considered an athletic competition.  Lebron James is dominant not ONLY because of his skill but also because of his athleticism.  You can't be a good wide receiver unless you are also athletic.  

Besides, if athleticism entered the equation, why do men and women compete against each other in equestrian events?"

Yolanda James? How do you feel about someone who is compelled to bring $100,000 per year in electoral contribution to the electoral coffers of her party so she won't be booted out? At least, did she lose a bit of her luster once you learned that?

&gt; I may still vote CAQ - Legault is a bonafide businessman (he developed Air Transat).

Businessmen are totally incompetent to run governments, because governments are not business.

But what makes François Legault even more unqualified was his use of unions at Air-Transat to go through though times, and then when business picked-up, quietly selling his actions without telling his partners.

So, that would make a terrific leader, someone who stealthily bails out from his partners by leaving by the back door…"

I have a friend who is always successful in job interviews. One day we're talking about interviews and resumes and whatnot, and I ask him what his secret to success is.

The key, he says, is the ""where do you see yourself in 10 years"" question. When posed this question, he will take a minute, flash a pensive look towards the sky, then lock eyes with the interviewer. ""Space.""

I ask, Space? What the fuck, don't you work in finance?

As he extrapolates on this answer, I realize how perfect this response really is. It gives him a chance to talk about human advancement, and how the world we live in is becoming crazier and more amazing every day. It allows him to boast about his desire for worldliness, and doing things that push the envelope. He can also talk about his optimism and his belief that even seemingly unrealistic goals are always able to be attained if you have a vision for the future.

Most importantly--the answer is *really fucking funny.* It ensures that the interviewer will be thinking about him all day, even telling their friends about the out-of-the-blue (out-of-this-world?) interview answer they heard today.

He's gotten every job that he's interviewed for after giving this answer.

24004,,,,,-45,"&gt;and are you threatening to delete my comments in a debate? Is t that a bit abusive of mod status bro?

Nah, I'm just giving an example of how we can shut down the conversation for no real reason.

&gt;I told you one thing: that if you are living a promiscuous lifestyle you should inform your partners.

And I generally disagree, largely because of how impractical it would be in a given situation. Many of my ""partners"" aren't my girlfriends -- for many of them, we've only known each other for an hour or two. And neither of us goes into any detail about our sexual history, and we definitely don't start detailing our sexual ""profile,"" or anything like that. It just wouldn't make much sense in the situation. And I'm saying that if you're even *dealing* with situations like that in the first place, then you're already possibly passing on STDs without the other person knowing about it. 

And that's bad, but again, for the most part, it can't be avoided. Even if you find out that you're ""clean,"" you could still have something. Even if you find out that you have something, it still might not matter at all. Is it good to get checked every so often, just for the hell of it? Yeah. Should you tell the girl about it? Sure, if the situation allows for it. "

When animators, such as myself, go to school we watch all sorts of animation, from ones that are crude, black and white or drawn using other methods (South Park, Archer), it expands our creative thinking process of what can be done artistically. 

Artists will use visual art styles to help them convey a story. The next time you watch an animation ask yourself, would the message and feel of this animation have been different if they used a different technique? For example how would Nightmare Before Christmas feel if it was in the same animation style as Big Hero 6? In vice versa how would Big Hero 6 feel in Nightmare Before Christmas' artstyle and animation style? 

What Big Hero 6 did, was it essentially combined Pixar's traditional ""realistic play-doh"" art style with the art styles of anime and (where this type of story arc is mostly from) and spent ENORMOUS time on the aesthetic realism in the backgrounds. 

This all comes together heavily at the climax. I don't want to spoil it, but there is a VERY VERY complex set at the end that utilizes the little details and visually stimating scenes they create. 

About the blur effects: animating REALLY REALLY obvious things are super easy. What I've noticed Disney does REMARKABLY is animate mannerisms in a character. If you watch, they move with slight deliberation when they shrug, roll their eyes, or fidget. This is HUGE and REDICULIUSLY difficult to pull off. The same thing goes for perceiving extremely quick movement. The blurs are so subtle your brain automatically is like ""that's just like in real life!"" But as an animator, creating those blurs so they don't punch you in the face is really tedious and to many (myself included) not worth it. In Big Hero 6 they pulled this off, multiple times. 

These effects can be studied by new generation animators to help us leap to the next level and tackle even BIGGER difficulties within the animation world. 

Edit: the biggest thing for me, is that Big Hero 6 animated a seemingly emotionless robot which no visual ques or color and turned him into an ADORABLE character FULL of emotion, just by how he walks and holds his posture. "

I didn't know that I was living in an abnormal society or that apartheid was wrong. When I first started hearing political mumblings about these things during my teenage years, I simply couldn't wrap my head around it. Imagine an uneducated hillbilly from Mississippi watching Jon Stewart on the Daily Show. It was something like that.

Today I have a lot of my old friends from back home on facebook (I live abroad now), and almost all their status updates are about how great God is and about the power of prayer. We grew up with something called a Christian National Education. From where I'm standing now, South Africa and most South Africans are puerile and extremely watered down intellectually. My mother, and most coloured people from my home town can sit and watch Oprah, Doctor Phil, clairvoyant people who contact the dead and The Bold and the Beautiful all day long, and when discussing any sort of personal problem they'd quote Dr Phil or Oprah as the highest authorities.

It's a douchebag thing to say, because I care a lot about these people, and when I'm with my old friends I fall back into that old persona that they still embrace and expect me to be. Part of me still loves it, but I get impatient and really wish that people can get a move on and start thinking clearly about their circumstances and old ideas.

What I'm saying, to get back to your question, is that it's obvious to me that it's normal to not be a near-fundamentalist Christian, a racist, a sexist and a homophobe. 

I don't know if that answers anything. I have a feeling that I'm leaving huge chunks out, but I'll update as stuff come to mind."

 I was on the other end of this once.

 One summer after college I moved from the dorm back home to my parent's house. All of my college stuff (bedding, winter clothing, school supplies, and desktop computer) went into storage in the basement of my Dad's office. It's a huge storage space where we stored the family's jet skis, my dad's antique Mustang, and all sort of other stuff. No big deal.

 Well, the basement flooded that summer. My dad swore that the water damage wasn't that bad and my stuff didn't get wet. I trusted him so I never checked on my belongings.

 Come August I pull out all of my stuff. I open my bin of winter clothes and the smell hits me - MOLD. EVERYWHERE. Dear God, the water did get into my belongings and it festered for 8 long weeks in the dark, warm basement. 

 My winter clothes were ruined as well as my nostrils. I bought new clothes and carried on my merry way back to college to start my sophomore year. I tried plugging my computer in at my dorm but it wouldn't start. Hmm...so I took it to a repair shop. 


A few days later the repair man calls me and says ""Um, ma'am, you need to come in...."" I go in. They show me the inside of my desktop. Not only was it all rusted, there was MOLD. Mold in a freaking computer, I shit you not. 

 I tried to explain the flood but the guys obviously thought I was a stupid college kid (which I was). So please forgive us for our gross computers. 


TL;DR - Mold grew in my desktop."

19747,,,,,117,"Google Inc. is a  multinational public cloud computing, Internet search, and advertising technologies corporation. Google hosts and develops a number of Internet-based services and products, and generates profit primarily from advertising through its AdWords program.

When a client computer attempts to connect to Google, several DNS servers resolve www.google.com into multiple IP addresses via Round Robin policy. Furthermore, this acts as the first level of load balancing and directs the client to different Google clusters. A Google cluster has thousands of servers and once the client has connected to the server additional load balancing is done to send the queries to the least loaded web server. This makes Google one of the largest and most complex content delivery networks.

  Google requires large computational resources in order to provide their services. Racks are custom-made and contain 40 to 80 servers (20 to 40 1U servers on either side), while new servers are 2U Rackmount systems. Each rack has a switch. Servers are connected via a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet link to the local switch. Switches are connected to core gigabit switch using one or two gigabit uplinks.

  Since queries are composed of words, an inverted index of documents is required. Such an index allows obtaining a list of documents by a query word. The index is very large due to the number of documents stored in the servers. The index is partitioned by document IDs into many pieces called shards. Each shard is replicated onto multiple servers. Initially, the index was being served from disks, like it's done in traditional IR systems. Then in early 2001 Google switched to an in-memory index system, as they had found that they had enough replicas to keep a copy of the whole index in main memory (each shard is partitioned over memory of all its replicas). This switch had ""radically changed many design parameters"" of their search system, and allowed them to enjoy a big increase in throughput and a big decrease in latency of queries."

Firefighters get a decent amount of gratitude ever since 9/11, but before that it wasn't anywhere near the thanks that people in the military received.  Policemen I'd argue get almost no thanks for the job they do.  All you see are posts of ""Fuck the Police"" and stuff like that.  Everyone hates the police because they got a speeding ticket or parking ticket once in their lives.  But if you've ever lived in a rough neighborhood the one person you'd love to see more than anything else is a cop.  Yet most people, who live in suburbia, don't have to worry about crime rates and only see the cops as no-good out to get them a-holes.  But they see military folk on the news sacrificing their lives on a daily basis for our freedoms.

So in summary:  Military people get the most thanks and respect (in my opinion) because of the media and news bringing tons of stories to the forefront of peoples minds.  Firefighters are next in line for gratitude because of the publicity of 9/11.  Police get shat on because nobody likes speeding or parking tickets and very few people trolling the internets need police to clean up their neighborhoods. 

**TL;DR:**  In reality they all risk their lives to make our live's safer, better, etc. but military personnel are on the news more and more closely associated with risking it all.  Hence, they seem to get the biggest show of support."

Personally, I feel that the biggest thing that people forget is that the Ref on the ice has ultimate authority, whether they make a bad call or not.  If a referee determines, say, [not to call slashing on something that was clearly was an extremely egregious slash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FigpaoLPeHo), there is not real recourse.  

In the Dallas case, the Referees determined that it was a goal.  Whether or not it should have been disallowed is irrelevant.  The referee called it, and the Stars won.

I think it depends more on the problem than on taste.  When problems  fit within the Haskell or ML type system, the type system is wonderful  because it catches a lot of errors. But there are problems that intrinsically require some form of dynamic  typing.  If all you have is a statically typed language, you end up  writing a mini-dynamically typed interpreter in it to solve those  problems.  Sometimes that is still an OK tradeoff, sometimes it isn't. Dynamic typing also lets you write code more incrementally: during  development, you can replace functions one by one in the running image  and things do not need type consistent all the time.  That can be a  big advantage for exploratory programming. So, I think the Haskell and ML type systems are fine for many  applications.  But I also think the difference between static and  dynamic typing is not just a matter or preference.  Occasionally, you  really need the dynamic typing.

I was a bartender at a classier martini joint while in gradschool and had been working there for maybe six months when we hired a new waitress. She was young 18 or 19 and very good looking. Blonde petite girl next door. For perhaps a week we would flirt lightly, I really didn't think much of it as I pretty much chatted ladies up as part of my job and was always rather coy when it came to girls. 

Wednesday night came and it was the usual dud, couple of office folk unwinding no traffic to speak of so  along with my bar back Jimmy decided to close up early midnight or so and have our shift drinks. The waitress, we'll call her Caitie asked if she could hang out with us for a while as her roomate's boyfriend was visiting, and she didn't want to cock block or some shit I don't recall. One drink lead to another, and soon Jimmy and I were mixing a drink for Caitie, I know it's illegal because she's underage, but honestly she seemed cool enough and heck I was in college drinking was a part of the lifestyle. 2 am rolls around and I decide to close up for good and call it a night, Caitie calls some friends because she can't drive Jimmy lives in a loft apartment just down the street so he walks home. I was left alone at the bar, I washed the glasses cleaned up and locked the doors and went home.  I had the opening shift the next day so I'm back at the bar cutting my lemons and polishing wine glasses when who should happen to wander in, but my favorite campus liason officer. Officer Beyers and I had developed a decent raport over the years. I'm a very polite and cooperative drunk and he's a man who appreciates that kind of thing. 

""Hey guy, I'm gonna ask you straight, and I want you to tell me straight. What went on here last night?"" 

Shit, Jimmy got hit by a bus or something walking home or... fuck; Caitie. I tell him the whole story leaving out nothing. Officer Beyers tells me that Caitie was so drunk last night she had to be taken to the hospital, she's claiming that not only did I feed her massive ammounts of alcohol I took advantage of her sexually. 

My heart stops...

Hands behind my back for a ride downtown... Here's what went down after Caitie left the bar, she went with her friends, people she had just met that day, and got shit canned at a party. Her friends dropped her off at the dorms where Caitie destroys her room puking and what not all over the place, her roomate freaks and calls the RA, the RA calls the ambulance and Caitie is brought to the hospital, instead of being able to fess up to the fact that she couldn't handle her liquor and was responsible for her own actions she fabricated a story about a charming bartending devil in disguise who made her concoctions that were ""spiked"" with some drug or something, who then raped her and sent her on her way to go fuck up her dorm room.  
The only reason I'm not in jail today? My work had installed cameras **1 Week** before that boring Wednesday night. They backed up my story while obviously exposing her as a liar. I lost my job (deservedly), and apperently even though it was proven she was a liar she spread rumors that I had in fact raped her, but had gotten away with it so I also lost my reputation for a couple of months untill she tried the same shit on another guy, and was proven to be a liar again. 

TL;DR Women hate to be raped, but some women love to pretend they were raped

Edit: Thanks for the response of support on here, but I worry that some of the rhetoric is getting out of hand, as posted in some comment responses: 

&gt; And this is why such bitches (anyone who would make a false accusation of rape or child molestation is not a woman and should not be termed as such) should serve 10-20 years in prison and register as sex offenders for life.

Although I tend to agree with you because of my experience, I must say that such penalties may discourage legitimate rape victims from coming forward out of fear if the guy beats the rap she'll go to jail for being raped. Our legal system isn't perfect, but there must be ways to defend both rape victims (such as mandatory rape kits) and men who are accused. The real issue is that an acusation of rape doesn't come witha presumption of innocence it comes witha presumption of guilt

&gt; Fuck me sir, I'm sorry to hear that.How long ago was that? If it's less than three years ago you should speak to a lawyer and think about a defamation lawsuit. Especially if she's done it again. Not only would you be compensated but she'd think twice about doing it again. Indeed the fact that she's done it again since might help to get you punitive damages.

It was several years ago, and I've moved past it, it still bothers me to think that my life, marrried with a beautiful wife and son would have been radically different if Jimmy hadn't been skimming from the till, and my boss hadn't installed cameras to catch him.

You can’t because they’re one and the same thing.This is a community that’s, you know, 15 or 20 years old, and the sexual harassment is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it’s not the fighting game community--it’s StarCraft. There’s nothing wrong with StarCraft if you enjoy it, and there’s nothing wrong with anything about eSports, but why would you want just one flavor of ice cream, you know? There’s eSports for people who like eSports, and there’s fighting games for people who like spicy food and like to have fun. There’s no reason to turn them into the same thing, you know?

I don't think Obama is escalating things in Afghanistan for laughs; I think he's genuinely concerned that **Pakistan** -- with its nuclear arsenal -- will fall to Al Qaeda, and stabilizing Pakistan requires stabilizing Afghanistan as well.  Throw in an already-jittery nuke-happy India into the mix, and those three states become a sinkhole of trouble *if it stays neglected.*

Lets use the example of If a mob informant with a hit out on him by the gambino family walked in to a police station.

Detectives will ask questions, try to poke holes in his claims and check the validity of his story. If it mainly checks out, he's going into witness protection because criminals are out to kill him. If it doesn't check out, they decide he is full of crap and probably high. 

The debunkers are going to tell him it sounds paranoid because sometimes they see movies about this stuff and call a psychologist. They then will hand him to some shady looking guys who walk in and say they are his ""family"".  Those men will drag him out and shoot him. The debunkers will say he probably was sad and committed suicide. 

The fbi agents involved, politicians from the investigation, cia and policemen, firemen, engineers, etc, are the ones saying the official story stinks to high heaven.  The arm chair debunkers who dismiss the evidence without examining it say everything is fine.  

Notice on reddit that the NSA filed freedom of information acts and now know bush was lying about knowing bin laden had an operation to attack in progress. It took us 12 years to learn that.

They're foot soldiers for the likes of the Koch Brothers, John Boehner and his anti-middle class ideals, politicians who regularly slit the throat of the middle class while simultaneously protecting the massive riches of the ultra wealthy and ultra elite.

There's no reason or logic behind any of this. That's why pointing out to them that republicans and democrats aren't the same won't do any good. It would be different if they used truth and reason for some kind of standard of logic. They don't. 

Without that mindless approach to politics and this sycophantic approach to worshipping the rich, things would change. People might start having access to health care. The infirm and the elderly might have a shot at living decent lives. Poor kids might get a free meal at school and those who lose everything they own to a natural disaster might get some kind of assistance.

You know, all that 'socialism' that democrats are so fond of, that America has always been a part of. At least when it was the best country in the world and the envy of all other nations. 

If you think about it for just one minute, it's not hard to figure out why this country remains in the corporate death grip. It's because there is a huge percentage of the American population that do everything they can to make sure it stays in place. Even though it is directly against their own personal interests and the interests of their families. 

Fox News has created these economic suicide bombers who are stupid enough to sacrifice their own well being so that a guy who is worth $16 billion dollars won't have to pay his share come tax time. 

It's all a perfect circle when it comes to the republicans. They're stupid because they watch Fox News and they watch Fox News because they're stupid. And stupid people do things like electing representatives who would rather watch the middle class die in the streets than to do what the people want or what's in their best interests."
28818,"I met Emily only once but it's a pretty good story, I guess.",I met Greg only once,"I met Jamal only once but it's a pretty good story, I guess.",I met Lakisha only once,382.0,"I met Ryan Dunn only once but it's a pretty good story, I guess.  

One year my friends and I were at Gobblers Knob for Groundhog Day and they were filming an episode of Viva La Bam there.  We were all hanging out near the big bonfire because it was brutally cold.  A lot of those dudes kind of seemed ehh (Bam, for example, did not show his face once while I was there and Rake Yahn was pretty short with us but whatever). Ryan Dunn and Raab Himself hung out with me and my friends for a good portion of the night, probably because we didn't freak out just because they were celebrities and treating them like normal people. Anyway, a friend of mine there was in his wheelchair, and Ryan got on his lap and I pushed them through the crowd to get closer to the fire.  We had gotten pretty close to the fire but there was this like maybe 15 year old girl who wouldn't move out of the way so we could get any closer to the fire, so Dunn let her have it with things like: ""My friend sure would like to get a little closer to the fire but... HE CAN'T WALK!  I'm sure he would like to get around you and get some warmth, too, but HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR! MOVE!"" and when the girl ignored it, he just kept going on a 15 minute hilarious tirade until this girl finally moved (at this point I felt a little bad for her, by this point people realized who it was yelling and people all around us were laughing) and we were fireside.  

Hilarious, super nice, down to earth dude.  R.I.P."
328,,,,,5.0,"Where does it say it was because of suspected graffiti? Looks more like the cop caught up to a transit jumper. 

Now, let's go in order. The video starts with the officer running up to the suspect. Later in the video, around the 1:20 mark, I believe, the officer is heard saying ""Put your hands behind your back,  just stop resisting and put your hands behind your back"".... In a pretty calm manner too. He also comments on the running away part, but that's kind of muffled. I don't want to speculate to what is not heard or seen in the video too much. 



So let's talk about the controversial part here - the take down. Why did he do it? At 40 seconds we see the cop end his frisk and put his hands on the suspect's shoulders and give him a tug backwards. The suspect grips on to the billboard in front of him. I presume, due to lack of audio, that this was him telling the guy to put his hands behind his back (again, though, I don't want to speculate too much). When he didn't the cop took him down. A little over the top, but hell, none of us know the entire situation as to why the officer had to arrest the guy in the first place. Plus, if an officer tells you to take your hands down and put them behind your back, and you hang on to that object, that's a textbook definition of resisting arrest. 


After the officer puts him on the ground, the suspect struggles to get up, and is put down again. Then the suspect is placed in handcuffs. 

What I heard in the conversation as they were walking back:

""I asked you *muffled* several times to stop, get down, *muffled from the train""* (I really wish there was more audio to this... perhaps if the video the guy in the orange was taping gets posted?)

Things the officer did right:

* 1) Didn't get all riled up that he was being videotaped, simply did he job.

* 2) Got the guy in handcuffs without giving him a beating. A take down is a hell of a lot better than seeing a cop bust open a guy's face with a baton.

* 3) Once those handcuffs were on, that was the end of it. There was no yelling, smacking around, or any of that nonsense.

Things he could have done better:

* 1) The slam was hard, and overall it was ineffective. Going for the guy's arms would have been smarter, instead of just ripping him down.

* 2) He didn't use leverage just to put the guy down, instead he struggled with him awkwardly. Not only is that not safe for him, it's not safe for the suspect either and it just prolongs the arrest. 

I would like to know the actual details behind this arrest. So far I've seen it posted as ""Guy bodyslamed for graffiti"", ""Guy bodyslammed for jumping a turnstile"", and ""Guy bodyslamed for weed"". Honestly, nobody knows the real reason as to why he was arrested - only that he was arrested.

And its why I believe in god today....

I happened when i was losing faith in god actually that our church planned a youth trip with entire youth denomination of other churches down to Colorado. Watching the plains roll by on a bus I idly wasted time on my gameboy advance playing through super Mario world once again. In actuality the whole thing bored me, life bored me. I had come to the conclusion that god did not exist before even coming on the trip i had only come for the trip itself. Meeting the other kids was interesting though  Especially this one kid who must have smoked a pack a day and was like 16. However the person who interested me the most was this gorgeous girl all the way from Hawaii (The churches youth groups came from every single state). She had such a soft face, hair that reached her hips and usually carried a flower in her hair whenever possible. Although she was quite popular i got to know her personally as we spent dinner lunches and courses together. She seemed pretty smart as well, even smarter than me. I wonder how someone like her could believe in god as well.

One day i learned why.

It was a hiking trip to a local cliff/ hill me and the Hawaiian girl got to know each other pretty well. As the others advanced climbing up the hill me and the Hawaiian girl took our time discussing our pets and parents. As we reached the top we both were amazed at the surrounding nature of rhe world. It was then that i asked her why she believed in god. 

""Take a look around you. Everything here is gods work and is a part of him as it is part of you."" She said with a smile. I stood in amazement of how simple it all was.

""Everything?"" I asked her.

""Of course. The trees, the animals, the sun , the sky! Everything! Everything is a part of god and you are too."" She excitedly looking at me.
""So... The sea, the sky, the clouds and even the stars are all him?"" I asked looking around with a new sense of awe. 

""Yes"" she said looking around with me. Its is all gods work"" she said looking around with me. It was truly amazing how vast it all was and how insignificant we were. But then on horizon i noticed a dark cloud.

""Looks like a storm is coming..."" I said pointing at the darken cloud as it traveled toward us. 

""And its coming pretty fast."" I said with a looked on with shock as the dark cloud sped towards us against the wind. It was shooting lighting bolts upon the ground below as a uproarious thunder shot across the land. In a matter of moments it was upon on lighting shooting all around exploding the landscape. From the clouds came a mighty chariot led by two goats with large man driving lashing at the reins. He landed before us with a smooth glide and unlatched several nude women attached to his body. He stood in front of us and bellowed:

""I AM THOR"" he then raised hammer to the sky which was stuck several bolts of lighting with a thunderous crack. 

""LETS GET OUT OF HERE! HURRY!"" the Hawaiian girl screamed in my ear as I stood there looking at Thor in awe. Thor looked at the girl and took several strides towards her that shook the ground. She glanced in a panic at Thor and held out a necklace cross in front of Thor. 

""Stay back pagan! God in his migh-""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP"" Thor yelled grabbing the girl by the head. Thor held her up easily with one hand , her measly kicks hitting air. Thor then punched her in the shoulder sending her body spinning in a blur but leaving her head gripped tightly in place. Soon the body spun off her head still held by Thor and collapsed in a thick bloody mess. Thor then tossed head behind him which landed in a dull thump and rolled away.

""You...You killed her."" I said in shock

""BRETHREN BEFORE WENCHES!"" Thor bellowed gripping tight his hands into mighty brofists and slamming them together. 

""But she was innocent!"" I stammered

""O RLY?"" Thor muttered pointing at the corpse. It had become a swarm of blackened snakes slithering and sliding in all directions. Suddenly the head of the girl came to life screeching and flying at thor with a manic suicidal attack from behind. 

""Watch out Thor!"" I shouted. He looked behind him just in the nick of time to grab the head once again!

""CURSSSEEE YOU THOORRRRRRR!"" 

The head screeched at him its forked tongue flickering. Thor unhooked Mjöllnir and slammed it into the head with a mighty strike, exploding it with a clap of thunder. 

""THANK YOU."" Thor said. “I SEE THAT VIKING BLOOD STILL RUNS WITHIN YOU, BUT THAT DOES NOT EXCUSE YOU FROM WHAT YOU'VE BECOME!""

""Wait...what was that? What do you mean"" I asked.


""OH THIS?"" Thor said kicking at a piece of charred skull.


""THAT WAS ONE OF LOKIS SLUTS. A SUCCUBUS HERE TO LURE YOU AWAY FROM VALHALLA INTO THE WAITING ARMS OF THE FALSE SPIRIT! THE WHITE SPIRIT!"" Thor said angrily his eyes and beard ablaze like fire.

“LOKI WISHES THE WORLD TO HIMSELF! HE WISHES TO WIN RAGNAROK BY LURING AWAY MEN FROM VALHALLA AND INTO CHRISTIANITY! I WILL KILL HIM MY SELF WHEN THE DAY COMES!” Thor bellowed once again.


""THAT IS WHY I CAME HERE TO DAY. YOUR VIKING ANCESTORS SHAKE THEIR HEADS LOOKING DOWN FROM VALHALLA GREAT HALLS! LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE BECOME! A WORTHLESS SOUL DESTINED FOR HEL! YOU WILL NOT EVEN GLIMPSE AT VALHALLA YOUNG ONE! RIGHT NOW YOU ARE BEST AS FOOD FOR THE FROST GIANTS!"" Thor said spitting on the ground. The ground were spittle landed was struck by a lighting bolt. Thor turned and headed back to his goat chariot.

""CHANGE YOUNG ONE! BECOME A VIKING WARRIOR WHICH LEGENDS ARE MADE OUT OF! WE MAY YET SING SONGS OF YOUR TALES IN THE GREAT HALLS! AND IF YOU FALTER JUST BELIEVE IN ME WHO BELEIVES IN YOU!"" Thor shouted pointing a finger up to the heavens.

""AWAY!"" Thor yelled his goats pulling up into the dark cloud. Hot luscious babes reattached themselves to him with very audible moans. Moments later he was gone. 


And that's why I believe in Thor as my god.

 ""Dear Timothy, 

I've discovered a couple of serious problems with your research paper, one of them quite serious.

1.  You only use four sources, when you were required to use seven.

2.  You have PLAGIARIZED several passages from your sources, in particular those by Brown and Simmons.  That is, you have presented large sections of THEIR writing AS YOUR OWN, without attributing it to them.  Indeed, without these sections (specifically on pages 1-2, the top of 3 and the middle of 6), your essay would be far short of the length requirement as well.

The latter is the larger problem.  As stated in the course policies section of the syllabus, ""failing to include sources, quote borrowed material or attribute that material to the writer or text you take it from will result in a zero for the assignment in question.""  I am therefore required to give you a very bad grade for this major assignment.

At this point, if you want to offer a defense of your essay, you may be able to avoid the grade of ZERO for this assignment, because much of your essay seems to be indeed your own work.  However, unless you present an explanation that entirely accounts for your stealing material from your sources, your grade for this assignment will remain very low, thus hurting your overall course grade substantially.

What happend?  I'll give you the chance to state your case before logging the final grades for the course, provided you do so SOON.

Signed, 
(Professor so-and-so)""

One problem, though.  My name's not Timothy.  The professor had sent the email out to all thirty-five or so students and not just the alleged plagiarist, giving us all heart attacks.  The prof sent out an apology email later.  I don't know whatever happened to that kid."

The plus side to polishing everything to a mirror shine is that the game will not suck. It will be good, possibly great.

But I remember that anger I felt when reason was staring people in the face, in the form of their own child no less; and they just laughed at it. However, I will gladly tell you about the church.

I was forced to attend ""The Church at Rock Creek"". This was mostly in my adolescence and was a ""non-denominational"" church where every other sermon was about money. This was due to the fact that the church itself had gone from a strip-mall location to an altered steel warehouse to a multi-million dollar eye sore. It's still down the road from my house and I actually had to go inside for my little brother's high school graduation.

I wanted to vomit the first time I went inside. Black marble floors at every entrance. The day care area was the size of a small house and had those plastic climbing tubes going down to the below ground second floor. ***There's a fucking Starbucks too.*** This is all before you enter the chapel which is also marble-floored and filled with the highest of high end electronics, speaker systems (Bose), and instruments. It's a strange thing watching the evolution of a future televangelist church, just thinking about that place makes me want to spit in addition to things that are against the law.

14822,,,,,134,"Sintering is not defined accurately.  

In my lab we press pellets out of oxide or nitride powders and then sinter them.  It does not require a vacuum furnace, some people do use a vacuum due to the inert atmosphere, we use argon.  

The powder is heated up to a sintering temperature which is far below a melting point for the refractories such as UO2 or DyN.  Through a process of mass diffusion the particles flow into each other.  

Alumina, for instance, can be sintered at 1200 C while it melts closer to 2070 C.

When viewed in an SEM you can still see spherical bodies that look almost as if they're melted together.  Melting does not occur in sintering to a high degree, once again it is a mass diffusion process.

I guess the main point is that sintering is not related to the phenomenon that was suggested to the title of this.

* With a team, you have a different problem: Unless you pay them, you don't have an effective way to control what they produce or how quickly they produce it.",2145.0,"About twelve years ago, I had a professional level designer at a big studio mock me on a major game-development forum for posting about my team's upcoming project, because I'd posted that I needed programmers, modellers, level designers, sound, etc., and had therefore revealed that all I had was a good-sounding idea and a website.  The conversation got ugly, particularly when he started dropping vulgarities at various people in the thread who came to my defense, and I remember how I felt a bit curb-stomped by the whole thing.

I'd rather walk away from this thread than do something like that.  But as someone working on their third MMO production credit, I'd like to make an honest, non-judgmental attempt to give you some perspective on the road ahead of you.

I'm assuming a few things here:

* I assume you have not completed development of a video game before.
* Since you haven't mentioned anyone but yourself, I assume you are not currently working with anyone else.
* I assume the talents you're bringing to the table, based on your comments, are art-related (and the game design, naturally).
* I specifically assume you have no programming experience.
* I assume you haven't selected an engine ([here's a great writeup](http://www.eldergame.com/2010/05/unity-2-6-for-indie-mmos-yes-but/) on the strengths and weaknesses of Unity, by the way).
* I'm assuming most of the last two years has been spent writing down details of the world, along with cool gameplay ideas.

If I'm wrong on any of that, correct me as needed.  But (and this is important) still take the rest of this into consideration.

So, with that in mind, here are a few of the pitfalls I foresee in the road ahead:

* If this is the first game you've ever made, I'm begging you, don't go straight for the MMO.  Take a little sub-section of your game, a minigame if you will, and build just that, as a single player game.  You'll learn so much you didn't even know you needed to know.  Even the big guys do this: [take Spore, for example](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10033443-52.html).  I have a grand MMO design that I'm splintering into small-game sub-designs and fleshing out in my spare time, because I understand how detailed the design needs to be and I recognize that I can't design it properly as one giant whole.
* No one has successfully made an MMO alone.  A game that persists online and builds a community simply requires too many features, too much art, too complex a server infrastructure, too much community oversight, for even a genius master-of-all-trades to do it alone.  One person (and honestly, even a half-dozen) doesn't have enough time to create a full MMO's worth of content in a short period of time.  ""Well, we'll just take a few years"" doesn't work, because you have the same problem Duke Nukem Forever had:  After three years or so, the bar for ""acceptable""-quality art has been raised so high that your work from three years ago needs to be scrapped and started over to get back to ""acceptable"" quality.  (This applies no matter how low you set the bar, unless you drop it to Minecraft levels and don't care at all.)
* With a team, you have a different problem: Unless you pay them, you don't have an effective way to control what they produce or how quickly they produce it.  If your team is online, there's an added danger: they can disappear at any time, without a trace.  If you didn't make them store their work on a server you control, then they can vanish and take their part of the project with them.  If the person who disappears is your programmer, it doesn't matter that you have a working build; you no longer have the code needed to make any changes.
* Speaking of programmers: an MMO is ludicrously programming-intensive.  If your programmer hasn't made an MMO before, your game's top risk (and most likely cause for failure) is that you're building an MMO engine with no experience.  Conversely, a programmer with MMO experience is likely working on an MMO (with a lot of unpaid overtime) and isn't available for a side project (or at least not an MMO-sized one).  Unity, by the way, is a client-side engine; you still need the server infrastructure and code, and mixing and matching client and server engines has led to at least one MMO failure that I've witnessed first-hand.  Full MMO engines exist, but the ones that have actually shipped a working title are priced at least in the six digits.
* Art is one of the biggest expenses in a commercially-produced MMO.  There's a LOT of it, it's time intensive to create, and it has to be turned around fast (see above DNF comments).  One person might be able to turn around mid-grade art for a small multiplayer game that reused content constantly, but you're generally looking at a team... which means you're looking at an art director to keep all the art in the same style and help manage who needs to make what and when.
* World-building is great, and I love doing that for games of all types, online and offline.  But again, to do this with other people, you'll need a full-fledged [design document](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3384/the_anatomy_of_a_design_document_.php): a bible detailing every little detail about the game.  If you can draw parts of the game on paper and play them out at your table using the design document's rules, then you've typically got the correct level of detail.  If your notes talk about a feature with the level of detail of the typical IGN interview, you need to design in more detail.  (Your comments here suggest this, if only because they they're vague enough to hide the possibility that specific implementations don't yet exist; I obviously don't know the truth, so I only provide what warning I can.)

So, to drive this home: Fully half of all MMOs commercially developed never release; half the survivors immediately fail.  If I was building an MMO ""on a budget"", and I had what I considered a ridiculously good design, and I wanted to ensure that it had a greater than 50/50 odds of success, I'd plan to use a minimum of 10-20 people and $1-2 million.  If that makes you spittake ... if you look at that and think ""that's absolutely impossible"" ... then I can't stress it enough: don't try to make an MMO.  Start small.

(And if you choose to proceed, [go to this blog](http://www.eldergame.com/) and start from the beginning.  He's walked the path you must follow.)

For most people who visit MFA, the opportunity to wear a suit is rare, so dropping several hundred dollars on shoes may not be a prudent decision.

Truth be told, there are fashionable shoes across the price spectrum (there are also crappy shoes at all price levels). I found a pair of shoes on clearance for $60 that look great. They are leather soled, have great shape and were surprisingly well constructed. With a regular polish, they've held up and continue to look great.

I feel that this subreddit too often implies that good fashion is only possible at great expense. Thrifty fashion may take more work, but it's entirely possible.

Pretty much the same thing except when my teacher told everyone to be friends with me it was when I had run out of the room sobbing cause I found out my mom had breast cancer that morning. When I came back from my cry two girls who usually only hung out with each other walked up to me and told me to be on their team for the book bowl. I don't know if anyone else does this at their school but the book bowl is where everyone gets into groups and makes a float on a wagon to represent a book then walks around school while overexcited parents take pictures. Anyway, I was thrilled to be in their group. We all worked together at one of the girls houses and cranked out an awesome Tail of Desparaux float. After that I considered them my best friends, so as you can imagine they were the first ones I told when I realized my mom was on the road to recovery. After I gleefully told them there was a moment of extremely weird silence and I kid you not, here is an exact quote from that day which has been burned into my memory ""It's cool that your moms alive, but Mrs. Car only wanted us to be your friend cause she didn't want you to be lonely if your mom died. Now that she's ok I'm pretty sure we don't have to hang out anymore. Hang on, we could ask her."" you can not fathom the extreme shame I felt as they left me standing alone on the playground to ask my teacher if they were still required to be friends with me. Apperently Mrs. Car had said ""it's up to you"" thinking they would make the right choice.. They didn't. Eventually towards the end of the year a new girl came to our class and me and her were instantly best friends. I don't know if anyone ever told her about my pity friends or my few months of depressed loneliness, but I never did."

EDIT: You know what I love about Reddit? It's so much easier to down-vote than it is to think and respond. If not big spending, money printing government, then what makes the paper worthless? If the Constitution grants the federal government the authority to nationalize banks, what is that authority? What the Constitution does do is grant is the right to due process and compensation before any property can be taken, so nationalizing a bank without such process and compensation is unconstitutional.

SRS seem to focus on linking to content that they consider offensive (and in my view some of it is, some of it isn't). I imagine that in some cases, content that is linked to may get down voted or occasionally SRSs may join in on a discussion (although I note that OP states this is not that common).

But SRS is accused of quite horrible things. I've seen them accused of contributing to a MensRights moderator (or maybe contributor?) committing suicide, to posting CP in a bid to get PreTeens banned, of harassing and abusing redditors and generally ruining everything.

But it seems to me that they're primarily just linking to content. There seems to be such a disconnect between action and perception. Or am I missing something?

Going back further, the historic land of Israel was only re-named Palestine by the Romans as an insult to the rebellious Hebrews who they had defeated and expelled. They named it after the ancient Hebrew's historic enemy the Philistines, who at that time no longer existed as a people. The modern Arab ""Palestinians"" have absolutely no historic connection to the actual Philistines, although they often claim to.

In fact, the Arab ""Palestinian"" identity and nation was specifically invented and promulgated by Yassir Arafat in the late 60's as an intentional falsehood to help in gaining international support for his war against the Jews.

If I had any money at all, rather than £15k in debts, I would be betting that neither the US nor France GAVE nuclear weapons or plans and designs for entire nuclear weapons. 

The official story is that Israel began researching nuclear technology in 1948, started sending a small amount of students off around the world to study in the field, including one student working with Fermi in the US. Israel then made an agreement with a French company to provide a 24MW reactor and a guaranteed fuel supply, although the reactor that was built was probably well over 72MW in capacity.

In regards to weaponising nuclear technology in Israel, credit has to go the Israelis, conventionally weapons grade plutonium is separated from spent fuel rods from reactors via centrifuges, the Israelis were very limited in this respect, due to the space and fuel available, as well creating the facilities without international recognition.

Luckily, those cunning Israelis in 1973 patented a process called Laser Isotope Separation, which worked using lasers, not centrifuges, they then sold the commercial rights to the research to a French company although the research has not been developed to form a facility that we know of, it is suspected that the Israelis have their own laser facility set up, this has advantages as the facilities can be a lot smaller, and their construction more easily hidden or disguised.

Then there is a whole load of rather questionable activity involving South Africa which was developing it's own weapons and had an indigenous fuel supply much larger than the Israelis. This episode comes to a head with the Vela Incident, which I will leave you to look up on wikipedia if you can be bothered (it's quite interesting, go and waste you afternoon).

Many other countries have been involved with Israeli nuclear technology for various purposes, even the UK sold them a large surplus of Heavy water that was originally sourced from Norway, a country with a tumultuous history with Israel.

Further evidence of Israeli development of nuclear weapons as opposed to merely being given or buying the plans and equipment from other countries comes from Mordechai Vanunu's reports. These indicated that Israel was potentially close to making two stage weapons such as the Neutron Bomb, whilst France had already developed this it is unlikely that the specifications were just handed over. The Israeli spying on the USA and other countries was rife and probably still is. They were spying on the USA nuclear strategy for years as they did not have their own satellite facilities and couldn't target Soviet Nuclear facilities, one of just many threats they perceived.

Now they have nuclear weapons on all platforms, air, sea and land with a variety of delivery systems. But won't admit to it, although they did say that Iran aspires ""to have a nuclear weapon as America, France, Israel and Russia."" before a spokesman several hours later noted that Prime Minister Olmert comments had been taken out of context...

And that is the short history of Israeli nuclear development.

This information is outdated; it does not take modern genetics into account.

Based on recent genetic research, if we were to split the world population into a handful of major lineages, there would probably be just two still living today: the [San people](http://htl-wireless.com/San_People.jpg) and everyone else (Asians, Aborigines, Caucasians, Native Americans, the vast majority of Africans, Polynesians, etc.). (If you want to learn more about this, [The Journey of Man](http://www.amazon.com/The-Journey-Man-Genetic-Odyssey/dp/0812971469) by Spencer Wells is a good start.) 

But within these two groups, there are still a great many only-distantly related lineages. Africans in particular are an exceptionally diverse group of people—which makes sense, because Africa has been populated for the longest period of time *by far*, which means there have been many more generations of people there diversifying. There are African lineages that are more closely related to Asians and Caucasians than they are to other African lineages. This makes sense if you think about it; by the time the ancestors of Asians and Caucasians crossed into the new continents, Africa would have already been well populated (perhaps overpopulated, driving these migrations), and only a few African families would have spawned the Asians/Caucasians, not *all* of them.

As you can see, the [Fula people](http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000Fb_cfWaf1zo/s/750/750/Northern-Burkina-Faso-Fulani-African-Singing-Dancing-Music-2010-13700-ireneabdouphotography-com.jpg) have very different facial features and skull shapes from the [Mongo people](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Mongo_family_in_Equateur_Province.jpg), who are distinct from the [Igbo people](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Igbo_Roman_Catholics.jpg), and so on. Don't be fooled by the similar skin colors; dark skin color is an adaptation to the sunny conditions in Africa and does not imply genetic relatedness.

And just because people make this error a lot, I want to point out that African Americans do not represent Africans, and any study that attempts to make this connection is flawed. African Americans are derived almost entirely from a small proportion of the African population—and from a relatively small corner of that vast continent—plus Caucasians to a lesser extent (white slave owners often fathered children with their female slaves, and plenty of intermixing has occurred since then). Africa is drastically more genetically diverse than that.

Im incredibly self conscience about it to the point that I almost cant communicate with women because I feel like they dont view me as being a 'real' man. I wrestled in high school the 103-125 weight classes and had to do a ton of weight cutting and I have been unable to gain a pound since. I know this might be a broken record to people who have to watch what they eat but I consumed between 4000-7000 calories a day for weeks and worked out all the time. I toned up and got much stronger but I weighed the exact same as I did when I started. It is incredibly discouraging for me to even attempt to do anything about it when I have been trying for years to no avail. Ive had blood work done and everything because they thought that I had cancer or some metabolic disorder but nay, I just have a freakish metabolism. Im so self conscience about it it is debilitating and humiliating. I consider myself to be relatively attractive too, I dont think Im ugly, I have a great job where I make great money, an amazing family, and amazing group of friends, I take care of everyone indiscriminately if they need it and I honestly think I would be a great 'catch' for any girl that I meet, but Im so ashamed of my weight that I avoid situations that could lead to anything of the sort all together. 

I know this is kind of a rant but when people find things unattractive on the opposite sex (or same sex for the LGBT community) that they have NO control over fixing/changing its hurts very much. BTW I'm 22/m weighing 128lbs at 5'9"" and 6% body fat. Its just emasculating to hear and to anyone else that experiences this sort of social withdraw because of it, I know that feel.

EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this kind of an outpouring of love and support and Im very grateful that you all took the time to offer the words of encouragement. A lot of people have been saying that there is no way that I ate that much and I didnt gain any weight and wanted to know what my workout routine was. My dad was a power lifter in the marine corp and he put my regimen together so needless to say, he knows what he is talking about. My goal was 15lbs in however long it takes, I really didnt care if it was 5lbs as long as there was something to show for it. My routine consisted of nothing but compound exercises, dad told me 'squats, squats, squats', so thats what we did. Also, deadlifts, power cleans, bench press, preacher curls. Basically all the compound exercises you would expect. My diet was very closely planned and while I did not use a website to monitor my caloric intake, all of my meals were planned and the calories and protein totaled. I never made a spread sheet or anything on the pc or Id upload it but it was roughly 3000 calories per day in weight gainer shakes alone. Breakfast was usually around 4 eggs (or more if I was hungry) 2 pieces of toast with peanut butter, about 4 long strips of bacon, because bacon, and 2 pancakes or waffles. Then about 2 hours later id down a weight gainer shake. Lunch would be 2 cups of oats, as much milk as I could handle and usually leftovers from the night before which was almost always either chicken breast or some pasta dish. Lunch was, by far, the hardest meal to moderate because of work. About 2 hours after lunch, another weight gainer shake. For dinner was almost always either steak, chicken or pasta  and lots of it, served with salad, rice or potatoes and some greens. I noticed after the first week, maybe 2 weeks, that I did gain about 8 lbs but as my body was acclimated to the diet and the weight I was working out with started to go up, my weight steadily dropped back to where I was. By about a month and half of going broke buy food/supplements and having absolutely nothing to show for it but tone and totals (neither of which I was going for) my dad and I decided to see the doctor. I was tested for worms, cancer and metabolic disorder. I had none of those. In fact I was in absolutely perfect health with cholesterol being borderline too low and sodium right where it needed to be. Very discouraging, we all thought that there would be some indication of what was going on from the blood work but nope. Never felt so bad about being told that I am perfectly healthy. This is such a first world problems, its ridiculous which is why I feel so bad about being insecure. It feels like its not an issue that should warrant such insecurity but it absolutely does and the only thing I can really do is bide my time until Im 30 and, hopefully, by then I will have packed on a few."

Definitely, women ripped hundreds of thousands of men from their normal lives in their native country and forced them like cattle into disease-infested ships, then took them halfway across the world to use them as slaves, thinking of them as animals that deserved to be subjugated, beating them, raping them and profiting financially from their labor. Then, after some women had an internal war over the enslavement of men, men were ""freed from enslavement,"" but refused education, the right to vote (oh wait lol it was women who couldn't vote until the beginning of the 20th century), and forced into a position of servitude surprisingly similar to what they had left, prevented from taking jobs other than as laborers, comic entertainment, housekeepers or nannies etc. Little boys were prevented from going to the same schools as little girls (oh wait lol it was women who couldn't attend school), given pathetic facilities with paltry resources, where little girls received superior education... Finally, after hundreds of years of misery and subjugation, men finally crumbled some of the laws that prevented them from living a full and fair life. To make a 'women only' common room is to spit in the face of the historical suffering of man... It just makes me weep with the injustice of it all. :-'( :-'( :-'( "

I've lately been getting the horrible sense that America could be walking into, if not a typical dictatorship, some kind of totalitarian governance. I wouldn't expect it to be quite the same as anything else the world has seen before, but there are lots of signs and the conditions are ripe for some seriously dangerous political realities to emerge. 

Laws that violate the public's privacy, freedoms and basic rights have been springing up in the last decade along with an increasingly polarized electorate. The economy is fucked and the level of extremism in the Republican party is down right frightening. As much as I hate the conservatives in the UK, they are no where even fucking *near* as scary as Americans. Our conservatives seem just genuine in their views but with decent arguments (not as I personally see them) for their cause. The republicans - some like Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Santorum seem either sociopathic or psychologically fucked in one way or another. Mitt Romney especially - I'd go as far as saying pathological lying - and that's not being politically biased. You can see a whole host of videos of him stating his support for various issues, then on another occasion outright denying that he'd ever held those views. That's not normal behaviour ladies and gentlemen. He does it with no apparent embarrassment of difficulty in spite of clear evidence to the contrary. I've known a real sociopath and that's exactly like how they lie. Pathological lying is such, because it doesn't matter what their subject knows. Whether or not Mitt Romney is actually a sociopath (a clinical diagnosis should be required in fairness), a politician should not be able to act like that publicly without consequence. He should not be taken seriously. Mitt Romney would have been laughed out of politics in the UK the moment he tried stepping into it. I have dire concerns for America. I think it's in serious danger right now, and if I was living there I'd be making every effort to get the hell out of the country. Sorry, but America is not the best/most free country in the world.

They're good, they're not bad by any means (well, maybe Jade Empire), but they're nothing outstanding. Dragon Age versus Baldur's Gate, for instance. There's no depth there. No strategy. The most complex boss encounter was the Spider Queen, a fight so simple it wouldn't even be a challenge for level 10+ people in World of Warcraft. No real complexity or nuances in the gameplay, in the character building, in the party building, in the boss encounters, in the dungeon crawling, in anything. It's a very watered-down game with barebones frames of the older WRPG elements (like the joke of a skills system).

The same with all of their other games, really. Mass Effect ain't shit compared to real FPSes, and it ain't shit compared to real RPGs. Look at System Shock 2 for example. And really, when you think about it, the plots of Bioware games aren't that great either. They're not awful, no doubt, and there is some clever writing once in a while, and the dialogue can be quite good, and the presentation of the stories is quite excellent, but the plots themselves are really just dumbed-down pulp. Compared to the Planescape Torments and Deus Exes of yesteryear, it's like comparing the Night Angel Trilogy or Inheritance Cycle or some shit to Song of Ice and Fire.

Granted, it's all part of a larger trend of dumbing down mainstream games to appeal to a wider audience, but I think Bioware is really the forerunner and the biggest culprit here. They've taken old-school elements and dumbed them down dramatically and gotten more successful in the process. You can even see this reflected *in their own games*. Just compare, say, Mass Effect 2 to Knights of the Old Republic. No comparison there. Mass Effect 2 can't even be called an RPG anymore by any real definition. Then there's the other stuff. Atrocious DLC models, for instance. Who in their right mind could pretend Warden's Keep was worth the money? Or all the celebrity whoring. Okay, how does Felicia Day voicing a character seriously enhance the quality of a video game in the areas that matter?

The reason I single out Bioware, besides the fact that they're one of the most successful companies out there and nearly synonymous with WRPGs now, is because they're a really overrated company. No one, for example, thinks Call of Duty is seriously leading the forefront of the industry. Except retards and children and frat boys playing babby's first shooter or something. But you'll see actual hardcore gamers, people who have actually heard of stuff like Fallout (you mean there were Fallout games *before* Fallout 3?!) or the older classics like Grim Fandango or something thinking Bioware is a good company. And that breaks my heart, to see how far we've fallen. How far we've come from holding games up to the Baldur's Gate II standard to the Dragon Age standard. From the Deus Ex standard to the Mass Effect standard. All of this talk of best serieses ever, advancing storytelling and presentation, all of the overhype, and so on really just wounds me, as someone who cares a lot about video gaming. 

Bioware sold out. A long time ago. When I see interviews with Mike Laidlaw about how they've made the new animations and visuals for Dragon Age II really ""hot"" and ""exciting"" I have to wonder if they even give a fuck anymore. If anyone really gives a fuck anymore. Then I see all the circlejerking over Bioware that goes on everywhere including r/gaming and it reminds me of why I gave up as well."

He did those things *because it meant he could have the illusion of friends.* I agree, actions have consequences, and even though I've felt the exact same feeling he did when he decided to do these things for his ""friends"", I agree that he needs to be punished for not resisting the feeling. As I said in my comment, his email and internet usage should be monitored 24/7, but crushing his chances at a promising career is ***not*** the way to go about punishing someone. Imagine if your punishment for going 85mph in a 50mph zone was having your legs shackled together and tethered to your house for a year. Your missuse of one thing means that all your progress up to that point gets thrown out the window."

Summary:

So a while back this kid makes a YouTube account focused around his love of God and whatnot.  When 4chan came out of the woodwork to mess with this kid, a new YouTuber showed up, coming to the first one's defense.  This was ""Josh""  

Now, Josh was either being sincere about defending the Christian or just trolling for fun, either way, he was pissing the board readers off.  So people started attacking him, and when he found out it was 4chan, he ""declared war""  

So when 4chan hears ""war"" they get all excited, and post his docs.  So now his name, address, phone etc. are all floating around, and he's getting phone calls and death threats and whatnot.  After it gets to be too much for him he posts another video, where he claims to be an Irish atheist and that he was just trolling the people of 4chan and everything he said was joking.

Here's the problems with that:
1.  Anyone who's been trolling for more than a minute knows that you don't challenge 4chan, because they have the time and resources to hit back.
2.  His video where he claims he was trolling is full of problems, such as him not knowing where Donegal is located, his refusal to use his ""real"" accent, etc.  He also overacts, but thats just opinion.
3.  Theres a wav file of some English guys calling him and messing with him, in which he breaks down and starts crying about how they're ruining his life.  Then they call the Sheriffs office and give Josh's address, and while they're on the call a cop car rolls by to check the house out.  

TL;DR:  Kid is legitimate, but tried to claim troll when backlash got too bad."

1624,He had a kind of Emily vibe.,He had a kind of Greg vibe.,He had a kind of Jamal vibe.,He had a kind of Lakisha vibe.,144.0,"Maybe about six years ago, I was in the bathroom at work (midday, retail). I'm in there for a couple minutes, and I started hearing some noise in the next stall. Mostly grunting and groaning. I thought, ""damn, that guy is fighting it."" Then I heard, barely above a whisper, ""Yeah, you suck it whore."" When I was done, I went to wash my hands, a little confused, and heard more grunting and barely audible profanity. My curiosity got the better of me, so from a distance, I looked under the stall door. There was only one set of feet, and his pant legs were moving a little. To further test my theory, I opened the bathroom door, let it close, and stayed there to see if he would make anymore noise. We were the only ones in the bathroom, and he must have been keeping count, because after I ""left"" he got a lot louder and a lot more explicit. So I left and waited for a coworker to come by so they can get the manager on duty. I wasn't going anywhere in case the guy came out. I wanted to see what he looked like. The manager showed up and asked ""what's going on?"" I told him, ""There's a guy masturbating in the bathroom.""

""What do you mean?""

""I mean, there's a guy in there making a lot of noise, grunting and using profanity.""

""Well he could have a heart condition or something, you don't what he's doing.""

He was the least confrontational manager in the store, but he was the only one there.

I told him, ""People with heart conditions don't say what he's saying.""

The entire time customers were entering and leaving the bathroom, most of them coming out with rather shocked looks on their faces.
So the manager went in for less than a minute and came back out.

""I didn't hear anything.""

""Well he hasn't come out yet, so he's still in there.""

At this point, it had been about ten minutes since I left the bathroom. The manager kept popping in for a minute and coming back out saying that he didn't hear anything. I told him to stay in there.

While he was in there waiting to hear something, a couple other coworkers asked what was going on. I told them and they stayed too. There were probably four or five of us hanging out in the aisle when the manager finally came back out and said he heard the guy.

He said that when he heard him he knocked on the stall door and asked if he was okay. He didn't get a response, so he told the guy, ""you need to finish up and leave."" The manager left to take care of something else, but told me to call him if the guy didn't come out.

A couple of minutes later, the guy finally came out. He was a creepy little guy, probably in his mid to late 40s. He had a kind of Norman Bates vibe. He had a little smirk on his face as he walked by all of us that were standing there, and almost made eye contact with each of us. It was the only time I had ever seen a combination walk of shame/victory lap.

The difference: Nobody will remember or even care about Black Ops in 5 years, but BF3 will be remembered (even if it failed compared to CoD, it will be remembered).  BF games have been coming out for awhile now, but not like how often they push out CoD.  CoDis easily turning into the casual gaming of FPS games.  The campaigns keep getting easier and easier while also getting shorter and shorter, while the demographic of playing the game is getting younger and younger.

Sure, it takes some skill to play it, but I suck at Wii Bowling.  I consider myself very good at games, but I suck at Wii Bowling.  It takes some skills to be really good at Wii Bowling, and it also takes some skills to be good at CoD, but that does not mean that it is all of a sudden the most hardcore and best game on the market.

20915,,,,,5.0,"I've decided that this is the post.

You see, I've been perusing Reddit for a variable amount of time and every so often I see a post like this where it is upvoted solely because there are attractive girls in it.  If I posted a picture of myself as a baby and then myself now, nobody would care, all they would say would be ""Jon, you have a very, very impressive mustache"" and it would receive 10 - 20 upvotes at best.

So this is the post that I do this in.  

I am going to describe, in vivid detail, the sexual thoughts that I think when I look at both of those girls.

Now, keep in mind that I am legally allowed to do this.  I am a resident of a country in which the legal age of consent is 14.  Also, I legally attribute any and all liability of this post to my firm ""Ephebophile Ltd."" which is a shell company in the BVI with total assets of $10 and a stick of gum in case anyone decides to sue.  So without further ado, here they are:

When I look at the one on the left I imagine that she's the naughty one.  It's because her eyes are slightly more squinted, I suppose, but anyways I imagine doing her in a lot of non-descript locations like public park benches and in elevators.  She probably would want to do it doggy style and would enjoy every minute of it.

The one on the right seems like the sweet and innocent one.  She would take a lot of wining and dining before we made passionate love looking into each others eyes and shit.  I would probably buy her flowers at some point and tickle her with my mustache ever so gently.  

Now, both of them together would only happen on the wedding night of me and the one on the right.  I'd have been banging the one on the left on the side for years at that point, and I'd slip some ecstasy into the champagne at the wedding.  While all the guests were having an amazing time, I'd sneak off with both leftie and rightie and we'd make love together for the first time.  Oh the incredible release it would be, sexually and emotionally.  Walls would be broken down, I promise you.

I'm so sorry."

Why do you cater to our every whim? Girls never ever force you to do these things. Most girls think you're doing it out of the goodness of your heart and that you actually care. You're a lying bastard for letting her think this. Do you have some warped view that by doing us favours we'll fall in love with you? Do you not understand that confiding in someone = a friend, like every other female friend they have? Of course they don't view you as a partner.

The thing that ""nice guys"" all have in common is that in the end, they never really view the girl as anything more than something they can't get, and so they never go anywhere. Any normal person would just be forward about it, not sit in the closet denying it. A normal person would stop viewing the girl as a goal(and subsequently putting their misplaced anger onto her, insisting it's her fault which happens EVERY TIME. Look at you, calling her complaints ""pissy"".), but coming out and saying ""hey, I like you in that way. I think we should date.""  This is what normal people do. ""Nice guys"" can't seem to think that far ahead, they almost seem to prefer being a friend first and an SO second. Or so the girl thinks, due to how he acts.

Badass Jerks are the ones who make it known they want to be your SO first, and your friend second. You know the second you meet them what they're after. Girls go for this because they sure don't view him and anything more than that either. Between you and these guys, when compared to the perfect boyfriend, she chooses him, because a) you're a friend of hers, it'd be like dating one her other friends b) she doesn't think you actually like her like her.

The perfect boyfriend she's always telling you about is one who is socially capable enough to realize that favours and listening aren't the only things to being a friend, and have the brains to be a friend and a SO at the same time equally, someone who makes sure she knows what he wants, but doesn't let that rule their relationship.

The book appears to be out of print now, but there are used copies scattered around the net.",65.0,"I'm not sure that this fits your request (as far as being a ""civilization""), but the boyhood-to-manhood rituals practiced by the Sambia in Papua New Guinea have always been a great example to bring up when the debate over cultural relativity and morality comes around.

The Sambia have strictly followed gender guidelines that include, but are not limited to, having boys fellate older men until they reach a certain age, at which point they're put through a pretty rough rite-of-passage ceremony that puts them on the other side of the equation.

The core of this belief structure is the idea that semen (or 'manliness') is finite, and that in order to have sufficient semen to have sex with their wives later on (women are seen as essentially parasitic, IIRC), males must ingest sufficient semen as boys to build up their stores.

For acceptance of wanton violence, however, the Mesoamerican civilizations are tough to beat.

Images of religious figures were banned in Arabia early in Islamic history, to prevent idolization in the same was Jesus was by Christians.

After some time, pictures of Muhammad during his night journey, or significant events of his life, arose, and no one cared.  Outside of Arabia, this law didn't exist, but pictures of Muhammad were more common.

It's not a sin to portray Muhammad.  It's just the Wahhabi interpretation of the Hanbali school of thought of Sunni Islam that made this concept popular, with Saudi oil money.

I'm Josh (not the one on meth, but the one on shrooms.) 

First, I wanna thank my cousin Jordan for posting this.

Secondly, I'd like to provide a little context. I'm a comedian, and I was there with 20 other comics for our friend Tess's 30th birthday. We started the day at 9:00am with an Easter Drug Hunt (WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE), drank copious amounts of dark liquor and canned champagne and then went to the studio in a white escalade limo (i know, i know, when you see a fucking limo you think two things: 1. those guys are assholes or 2. that's a pretty cool quincenera)

We get to the studio and apparently they don't just let any schmuck on the Price Is Right, so they pre-interviewed us. We all decided to come up with different jobs, because we didn't think they'd let us on the show if we said we were comics. So it was everything from Baby Yoga Instructor to my friend Sean just screaming ""I WORK IN AN OFFICE BUT I KNOW HOW TO HAVE FUN.""

I was all set to say I was a purveyor of fine exotic birds and reptiles (i coulda been hiding a fucking lizard in my beard, you wouldn't have known shit), but y'know MUSHROOMS, so i froze and said the first two words that came to my head: ""Skateboard Rabbi."" And you guys I really really really wanted to win a fucking jetski, so I had to commit to that lie.

My favorite moment of the whole show was actually cut out for TV. When I first told Drew I was a Skateboard Rabbi, everyone started laughing, but the stage manager started scribbling furiously on a piece of paper, and he held it up and it just said

REALLY RABBI?

so then Drew starts pressing me, he goes all fucking Frost/Nixon.

""How do you incorporate skateboards into Judiasm, Joshua?""

and i just pulled a line outta my ass and said

""Well, Drew. We go to local high schools and try to turn Religious Extremism into Religious X-TREMEism!"" and then I think I did an air guitar solo. 

That's when Drew's face sorta changed and he got more quiet and stopped joking with me, because I guess that sounded enough like a bumper sticker or some shit that he actually believed me (that's why the cut is so weird when it goes to ""HE REALLY IS A SKATEBOARD RABBI!"") You could almost see the wheels turning in his head like he's all ""Oh shit, I was just making fun of a man of god! I gotta stop! FUCK! JEWS WRITE LETTERS""

so yeah. I'm not a rabbi, just another Jewish comedian with glasses and a fucking beard.

also, about the dolly parton shirt: it is NOT ironic. i wore it because i bought it the LAST time I did mushrooms in public-- at a Dolly Parton concert at the Hollywood Bowl. I CRIED 3 TIMES. SHE PLAYED STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN ON A FUCKING HARP, TALKED SHIT ABOUT WHITNEY HOUSTON FOR STEALING HER SONG, AND TRIED TO DO STANDUP. No joke she was all ""kids today need to get their heads outta facebook and get their face in the GOOD book."" GROAN i know but, again, MUSHROOMS, so I actually saw her words come out in blue comic sans.

Anyway, i'm rambling. Drew Carey was super nice and really funny. thanks for watching me be an idiot on TV. 

EDIT: Holy shit, thank you guys so much for all the awesome comments about me, and more specifically, my beard.

**EDIT:  After so many replies to the effect of ""That would make you a bully also, you are a hypocrite"", I felt I should respond in hopes of clarifying my stance, here is my response:**

So, there are a whole litany of (expected this) responses like this, so I'll reply to this one in hopes that it clears up where I'm coming from.

Ultimately, bullies are cowards. They pick on people they KNOW they can dominate, and they usually do it with a disparity of force (i.e. a bully and his five bully friends against one guy).  Most of these guys have never actually had their ass handed to them in a serious altercation, so they legitimately believe that they are the toughest thing walking around on two legs. Once they learn the hard way that they are indeed, NOT the toughest guy on the block, they will think twice before starting shit.


And for reference: I""m not a ""tough"" guy. I have walked away from probably 4-5 fights and set my ego aside completely, getting objects thrown at me and being called all manner of derisive names. I have only once in my life started a fight, and that was in defense of my little sister (a guy twice her size threw her to the ground). I abhor violence, but it doesn't actually matter how I feel about violence, because our world is violent and there are ignorant people who will walk around bullying everyone they can, until they finally learn the age old lesson: You are never the toughest guy on the block.

I'm sure from my comment, you all picture me as a tapout wearing MMA douchebag. I guess my comment certainly invited that, but the reality is that is the farthest from the truth. I'm the nicest guy in the world. I address my elders as Sir or Ma'am. I hold doors. I help people whenever and whereever I can in life. I volunteer for various charity efforts as part of my work as a Freemason.

But having said all that: I made a promise to myself a long time ago, after taking a nasty beating from my high school bully that I would never again be a victim, and I would never stand by and watch someone else go through what I went through. If you all haven't ever been bulled day after day, you can't possibly imagine how soul crushing it is.  I eventually became a wrestler and then switched to martial arts and I've had more than a decade of training now.  I currently cross train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and JKD (which is a hybrid of thai boxing, western boxing, wing chun, judo, and escrima).

If I see someone getting bullied (and by bullied, I mean being physically intimidated or physically battered/assaulted, if people are simply calling each other names, that is something doesn't merit outside involvement), I am going to get involved. Its entirely possible that the bully will turn out to be tougher than me, and I may indeed lose that fight and end up in the hospital or worse. I accept that. I KNOW I am not the toughest guy around. I accept that also.

What I will NEVER accept, is to let bullies do their thing unchecked. I recognize the slight moral hypocrisy in my stance and I frankly don't give a fuck.

Bully someone in my presence and I'm going to get involved, because ultimately, its about deciding that kind of world I want to live in, and I would rather potentially get my ass kicked than just pretend its none of my business.

I hope that for the rest of my life, I never have to put a hand on someone else in violence. I truly hope for that, but I realize that the world is a crazy place full of crazy people, and you don't always get a choice.

&gt;

&gt;The __infinite monkey theorem__ states that a monkey hitting keys at [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness) on a [typewriter keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter_keyboard) for an infinite amount of time will [almost surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely) type a given text, such as the complete works of [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare).

&gt;In this context, ""almost surely"" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the ""monkey"" is not an actual [monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey), but a [metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor) for an abstract device that produces an endless [random sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sequence) of letters and symbols. One of the earliest instances of the use of the ""monkey metaphor"" is that of French mathematician [Émile Borel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel) in 1913,  but the earliest instance may be even earlier. The relevance of the theorem is questionable—the [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) of a universe full of monkeys typing a complete work such as Shakespeare's *[Hamlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet)* is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the [age of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe) is *extremely* low (but technically not zero).

&gt;Variants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence. The history of these statements can be traced back to [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)'s *[On Generation and Corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Generation_and_Corruption)* and [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero)'s *[De natura deorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_natura_deorum)* (On the Nature of the Gods), through [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal) and [Jonathan Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift), and finally to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, [Émile Borel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel) and [Arthur Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington) used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics).

The only condition was that I didn't tell our mother, so we wouldn't get the standard ""video games will cause you to waste your life and end up driving a bus"" speech.

Well, one day he decided to change the password on me, telling me ""I was taking up all his time"" (despite the fact that I only ever tried to get on when he wasn't), and told me to go fuck myself.  I quickly came to the decision that this was bullshit, and decided to spite him a bit by letting our mother know he was playing WoW.

Bad decision.  The moment I mention World of Warcraft, she goes ballistic.  Screams out ""WORLD OF WARCRAFT!?!?!?  NOT IN MY FUCKING HOUSE!!""

If the roles were reversed, Daryl would have never made Lizzie look at those flowers. 

I think Daryl is the most consistently good character. He is gruff and sometimes anti-social... But he is always good. Even when choosing between his own brother, whom he loved, he couldn't be swayed away from his conscience. 

Think back to when Sophia was missing... Carol understood it was time accept the worst but Daryl refused to give up on a child. Regardless of the personal sacrifice.  

That's what Aaron sees in him... He has such unwavering goodness that he can quickly recognize it in others. The only thing keeping him from being the moral voice of the group is that he is not quick to impose himself on others. He isn't a leader or a follower, he is entirely his own man. And unlike Carol, he carries guilt with him like a lead weight. 

He really is a noble character. "

And that takes us to the question of what the value is of uploading a video of you just playing your own instrument over a pre-recorded track.

I would serve tables and do some dishes every now and then just for fun (to check out ladies) while I was around. I thought it was fun and I got to talk to people, which I really enjoy.

Anyway, one night two girls walk in. Very pretty, maybe 20-something old gals, blonde and redhead, that sat down at the corner table, smiled at each other and seemed to have great time together. They ordered very menial stuff. A shared salad for starters, then they both ate salmon soups and ended it up with hot cocoa. All this time they really seemed to be glowing and I suspected them to be a couple or maybe on a first date, whatever.

When I went to ask them if I could give them anything else, the blonde girl said that she wants to pay. She gave her debit card and I went to the cash register, put it in and noticed that the transaction was denied.  I walked back to the table to tell her that and she said that she's sorry, she wants to come to check it out. When she walked to the cash register, she took the best puppy face I've seen and told me. ""Listen, I knew I would not have any money on the account. I knew it before I came here. But me and Jessie, we've been together for so long and lately, we've had it quite hard with money. This was our fifth anniversary and I could not take it knowing that we could not even head out to do something fun. I will do anything, do the dishes or whatever you ever want me to do. Please, let me hold this front and help me out so we can finish this night while having fun.""

My heart melted a little and I told her that because she presented it so nicely, I would gladly pay the bill on her behalf with my card and that she would not have worry about it at all. I've been in the same situation, I know exactly how it feels like. She thanked me a lot and gave a sweet hug and they went to the table to carry on with their conversation.

I went to the back room, told the owner (I saw her overlooking the exchange) that I rang my card on the machine for these two girls, they had no money to pay but that I did not want to ruin their night. And that I hope the owner was okay with it after I told her what was the issue.

She just gave a hearty laugh. She is about 50 years old and a great person. I love her to death. She just told one of the chefs to prepare two huge ice cream portions. After they were done, she walked to the table were the girls were and put the ice creams on the table.

""Your girlfriend here had no money, yet she brought you here and wanted to have a great night. She came here knowing that she could not pay and offered Kalle-Erik here to do anything to pay for it. Now, would she just come straight to the register and asked me, I would have been more than glad to let you two eat here for free. A special night is a special night, even if money is tight. But she was a little silly and did what she did. That's okay, luckily we have sweet people here like the one who just paid for it. I hope you have many years together and that these ice cream plates taste great. ""

She then walked away and looked back, winking while saying ""And I damn right expect you two to become regular customers here.""

She went to the cash register, refunded my transaction and told me ""you damn romantic you, curse you all. You are bad news."" As she walked into the back room, the blonde girl started crying.

Ah, one of the sweetest nights of my life. I'm such a hopeless romantic."

Often, I will try to calmly lay out my grievances like this, and come back later to find no replies and 13 downvotes. I'm not collecting karma, but it hurts to be dismissed like that.

Studies on magpies show that they possess self awareness, and many people speculate crows and ravens (cousins of magpies) possess the same cognitive behavior.

&gt;When asked to clarify his remarks, Rivera said that he cautioned his own son against wearing hoodies. He explained, ""When you, when you see a kid walking — Juliet — when you see a kid walking down the street, particularly a dark skinned kid like my son Cruz, who I constantly yelled at when he was going out wearing a damn hoodie or those pants around his ankles. Take that hood off, people look at you and they — what do they think? What’s the instant identification, what’s the instant association?""

&gt;""Uh-oh,"" remarked Doocy, who nodded in agreement.

&gt;Rivera argued that avoiding certain types of attire was a necessary deterrent against racial profiling. ""It’s those crime scene surveillance tapes. Every time you see someone sticking up a 7-11, the kid is wearing a hoodie,"" Rivera said. ""You have to recognize that this whole stylizing yourself as a gangster, you're gonna be a gangster wannabe? Well, people are gonna perceive you as a menace."" 

He is making the association, he is drawing the parallel.

It seems the hacker group ‘anonymous^1’ has decided to target the Chamber of Commerce website for a DDoS^2 attack, effectively rendering the website useless. This is the same group and same tactic used in the past against organizations such as H.B. Gary Federal, Bank of America, Sony Entertainment, and the Westboro Baptist Church.

I disagree with this methodology whole heartedly.

The problem is, however, that the general masses do not believe a well written letter is a viable means of action to protest that which they disagree with. There is a disproportionate amount of people that believe the only way to get the PROTECT IP bill the media attention it deserves is to take down websites, and as such, plan to do just that^3.

I am writing this letter in hopes to prove the aforementioned ideals are false.

When the COICA bill was on the table, Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, became a hero of sorts to the general public for stepping in and placing that pending legislation on hold.  He stated 

""It seems to me that online copyright infringement is a legitimate problem, but it seems to me that COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when what you really need is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet.”^4

The PROTECT IP bill is seen as a re-drafted, yet equally disheartening successor to the COICA bill.

The summary of the bill begins with a recital of the now-standard industry claims about the financial harm caused by copyright infringement. Claims that interestingly enough were put in doubt by the U.S. Government last year, but are still used to push anti-piracy legislation through globally.^5

It is further explained that the PROTECT IP Act is needed as an extension of the already controversial domain seizures taking place under “Operation In-Our-Sites”; an operation legal experts^6 and Senators^7 alike have both critiqued heavily, questioning the Constitutionality of the practices used in the operations.

Furthermore, the PROCTECT IP bill states 

“If the court issues an order against the registrant, owner, or domain name, resulting from the DOJ-initiated suit, the Attorney General is authorized to serve that order on specified U.S. based third-parties, including Internet service providers, payment processors, online advertising network providers, and search engines. These third parties would then be required to take appropriate action to either prevent access to the Internet site, or cease doing business with the Internet site.” 

Although the above is already quite far-reaching, the bill also allows for private copyright holders to use some of the same tools as the Government. Without due process, copyright holders can obtain a court order to prevent payment providers and ad-networks from doing business with sites that allegedly facilitate copyright infringement.

While counterfeiting and piracy remain concerns to the public and private sectors alike, this bill is not in the best interest of the public and serves only to help the private companies.  It is with this thought that I reach out to you to find out where you stand on this critical issue.

I thank you for your time in reading this. As referenced above, I do not believe in the validity of attacking websites as a viable means of protest. I’d rather form a well versed letter. In doing this, I am hoping you allocate a reasonable amount of time in your response to my inquiry on where you stand on this controversial legislative bill.

Again, thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
brainface

Prior releases were so shit slow because they performed a three step process, first copying a basic Windows environment for the actual setup to run, this alone could take 5 minutes to extract and copy the files. Then you have your first reboot into the installation environment, which asked you a million questions at varying points of the install. This also had to manually seek for and decompress each system file on the CD and copy it into place on the disk. Then, once everything was finally done, it started fiddling with the registry and configuring your settings.

In Vista and later, a new installation process using WIM (Windows Imaging Format) files containing a complete image of the base OS. The installer literally decompresses this image directly to the disk, installs the bootloader, reboots and lets the OOBE perform hardware detection and configuration (this includes the aero visual assessment along with configuring all of your device drivers).

Not having to copy files individually but basically extract an image onto the disk, putting a limited set of options all up front in the installer so you don't need to attend to it *AND* streamlining the hardware setup has actually made Vista/7 the fastest and easiest to install Windows releases yet. They're still not blazing fast, but three hours is one hell of an overstatement.

As far as why Mint and Ubuntu take such a short time to install, it's actually a similar procedure. In prior releases (back before 10.04, I think?) Ubuntu used to initialize the disk, chroot into the installation directory and begin installing all the .deb packages for the base system through APT, this process actually took about 45 minutes back in the day including running all the configuration scripts.

Today, Ubuntu basically does the same thing that Vista and 7 do, it just dumps the contents of the live cd onto the HDD, runs a little cleanup and rewrites a couple of configuration files. This process is faster than the Windows setup because we're talking about roughly 1.5GB of data compressed down to 700MB or so, versus the 8GB for a Windows install compressed down to roughly 2.3GB.

So the difference simply boils down to the respective installation size of Windows and Ubuntu now, they both basically perform their installation the same way these days."

Dear [RECIPIENT NAME HERE],

I am writing to you today to remind you of a solemn and most sacred oath that the leaders of our country took over two hundred thirty-four years ago. This promise, first laid out by Thomas Paine, later refined by Benjamin Franklin and finally adopted to heart by each of the founding fathers of these United States once stood proudly as a key cornerstone of the founding of our nation. Sadly, first in 1860, and then further in 1956, this promise I speak of was broken by its leaders and has remained such ever since.

That promise, which is embodied in the United States Constitution, is commonly known as the 'Establishment Clause'.  It reads:

*Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.*

You are, of course, very much aware of this clause.  You are also, no doubt, aware that despite this, we as a country have emblazoned the words “IN GOD WE TRUST” onto our money, and “ONE NATION UNDER GOD” has been added as a part of our National Pledge of Allegiance, which our children are taught to say each day.

My letter today is to remind you what the founding fathers knew and wanted when they wrote this clause: that the United States was never intended to be a nation under the sovereignty of a god, but rather a nation of the people, by the people and for the people. This country was formed, and its constitution thus drafted, with respect for all of its citizens, regardless of their beliefs. This country was formed with the concept of religious freedom at its very heart and it was never intended that any one religion should ever be promoted by the government. To this end, it was never intended that government promote any religion at all, leaving that to the sphere of private citizenship.

On behalf of the many tens of millions of people in this country who are Atheists, Agnostics, Buddhists, or otherwise - who every day of their lives are reminded that they are not part of the official “WE” who trust in God, and who do not live “UNDER” him yet are subjected to say so - we ask you to please look into and understand our cause. As a leader with the responsibility for representing ALL of the citizens of this nation, in the hope that America will once again fully embrace the noble ideals it was created to embody, we ask that you support our fight to return the United States back to the secular path it was intended to be on.

We simply and humbly ask that religion be removed from our currency and that our nation's Pledge of Allegiance be reverted to its original form so that we may, once again and forevermore, be, “...one nation, indivisible...”

Regards,
[YOUR NAME HERE]"

Renaming them all according to the ephemeral demographics of the student body is silly. One of the reasons that students go to Glasgow is doubtless to experience the local culture and history of another country - that is indeed one of the reasons to go to university at all, so I'm not sure why you think they would want the university divorced from its own history and given placeless, multinational, multiethnic names.

By the same token, the city shouldn't rename the streets even though many of them are named after slavers, colonists, and otherwise repellant dead white men. Like it or not that's the history of the place and it should not be reinvented in some naming revolution just to appease the wishes of tiny cohort of ""campaigners"" - campaigners who suppose that women and ethnic minorities are so incredibly fragile that they must be sheltered from the harsh reality of history.

If people would stop comparing it to Call of Duty we might not be in the middle of this shitstorm. If you enjoyed 90's FPS, you will like the game. It's not going to blow you away, but you will have fun, which is the reason we play video games. I keep hearing the words, ""outdated graphics,"" ""two weapon limit,"" ""regenerating health,"" like they are going out of style, which makes me think that people are literally trying to NOT like this game.

Yesterday I was sitting at my house, pissed that I didn't cancel my preorder and spent $60 on a turd that the UPS driver was dropping off. Then I started playing and all that went out the window. This whole debacle reminds me that even in 2011, we cannot wholly trust professional reviews. Everyone needs to find a reviewer they generally agree with and listen to them. Jim Sterling @ Destructoid gave it a 2/10, which is ridiculous and seems to only be pandering to the ""OH SHIT THIS SUCKS"" crowd than actually reviewing the game on its own merits. Luckily I hardly ever agree with him on his reviews and hoped it was bull. If I had listened to the vocal naysayers, I would have missed out on a pretty good game that finally puts the development of DNF to rest after 14 years. I don't care that the game looks like a 360 launch game, the bottom line is that the gameplay is utmost enjoyable, you shoot things, duke cracks a one liner, you kill a rat in a microwave, you move on. I think I spent way too much time interacting with stuff all over every level, literally *everything* can be interacted with. Kinda reminded me how bad modern games are at easter eggs and interactive environments...nobody seems to be doing these things enough anymore.

Considering what Gearbox had to work with, I think it turned out just fine. It doesn't live up to 14 years of hype, but its not trying to either, its simply trying to be a sequel to Duke 3D and I think it does a good job of that: 7.5/10


**TL;DR:** Duke Forever is fun, feels like an old school shooter, haters gonna hate."

Edit: I am not saying Kobe Bryant actually committed a crime, or didn't mean to say that.  I was just trying to think of examples of people famously accused of crimes and how they were treated by the American public at large.  In fact, I was deliberately trying to think of people that were accused, but were either acquitted, charges were dropped, or were given light sentences.  Octomom, of course, committed no crime, but is still notorious.

Anyhow, here is a reading from my system.

http://i.imgur.com/i9q6Mcr.png

Core temps are reading as in the teens and twenties at idle, and don't really move much under load.  Actual ambient temp was 24c.  CPU socket temp was 36c at idle, and the only number(aside from GPU) to accurately rise with the increased workload, ergo the only reliable measure of CPU temp.  Indeed, my system throttles when the socket temp reaches ~60c and the cores are still reading ~35 because AMD implimented a broken and convoluted algorithm instead of an proper thermal sensor.

SPeccy and Core Temp are terrible for CPU temps on FX chips because they default to the core/package temps which, as I have shown can be as much as 20c off."

La Liga's head honchos favour Madrid so often it isn't even funny. The rest of La Liga is now just used to it. It's now part of the title-winning challenge for us.

The funniest example of this is the 2012-13 LFP awards. Madrid had just lost the league by 15 points in our 100-point season and did not get any individual awards, so they created a special award, the MVP, for Cristiano Ronaldo. This is independent of the best player award, which (deservedly) went to Messi.

Then, next year, they just removed the MVP award and gave most of the individual awards to players from third-placed Real Madrid."

* Aisha was already considered of marriage age: she was engaged to another non-Muslim man by the name of Lakisha before her marriage to the prophet.",17.0,"When people defend the prophet's pbuh marriage to Aisha, they're not defending child marriages for all periods of time. They're just saying if you look at the context, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary:

* The kind of marriage between girls 8-9 to men 50-60 was common throughout the world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q126oUJF6vw
* In 1880, the age of sexual consent in Delaware was 7. In addition, the age of sexual consent in most states of the United States was 10. Source: http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230?section=primarysources&amp;source=24
* Aisha was already considered of marriage age: she was engaged to another non-Muslim man by the name of Jubair bin Mut'im before her marriage to the prophet.
* If it was something perverted or out of the ordinary, the prophet's enemies would have seized this priceless opportunity to tarnish his image, name and message. But not a single one of them said anything. It was very natural and common. In fact, the first criticism towards the prophet’s marriage was in 1905 (1300 years later). Dr. Jonathan Brown expands on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE_zypf8DAU
* The idea was not the prophet's in the first place; a woman he knew (by the name of Kholah bint Hakim) suggested Aisha to him.
* The purpose of the marriage was not pleasure. The prophet never married anyone else as young as her. In fact, his first marriage was to a woman 40 years old, when he was 25. If he was interested in young girls, he would've married many of them during the peak of his youth and manhood, before the enormous pressures and pains of prophethood and all the wars, politics, and troubles that go with it, including his older age.
* The reason he married Aisha? To strengthen the bond between himself and his closest, most loved companion: Abu Bakr, Aisha's father.
* These ""bond marriages"" were common then and still common today, where tribes inter-marry to tighten their relations, sometimes following feuds, and sometimes just for the purpose of bonding for more tight-knit communities, e.g. a city is comprised mainly of three main tribes, so they inter-marry so the whole city would practically become like one family.
* The prophet married other women for the same reason. For instance, he married Ramlah the daughter of one of his greatest enemies, Abu Sufian, after which Abu Sufian's enmity greatly subsided and hatred and wars between Makkah and Madinah lessened.
* The prophet married a woman by the name of Sowdah bint Zamo'ah, who reached menopause. His marriages don't have even the remotest pattern of someone who marries for pleasure; he marries for higher reasons: to bring people together, to avoid bloodshed, to strengthen the community, and so forth.

Islam and science have always gone hand in hand:

&gt;Islam and science addresses the relationships between the religion of Islam, its adherents' (Muslims) communities and the activities known collectively as science. As with all other branches of human knowledge, science, from an Islamic standpoint, is the study of nature as stemming from Tawhid, the Islamic conception of the ""Oneness"" of God.[1] In Islam, nature is not seen as something separate but as an integral part of a holistic outlook on God, humanity, the world and the cosmos. These links imply a sacred aspect to Muslims' pursuit of scientific knowledge, as nature itself is viewed in the Qur'an as a compilation of signs pointing to the Divine.[2] It was with this understanding that the pursuit of science, especially prior to the colonization of the Muslim world, was respected in Islamic civilizations.[3]

&gt;Theoretical physicist Jim Al-Khalili believes the modern scientific method was pioneered by Ibn Al-Haytham (known in the Western world as “Alhazen”), whose contributions he likened to those of Isaac Newton.[4] Robert Briffault, in The Making of Humanity, asserts that the very existence of science, as it is understood in the modern sense, is rooted in the scientific thought and knowledge that emerged in Islamic civilizations during this time.[5]

&gt;Muslim scientists and scholars have subsequently developed a spectrum of viewpoints on the place of scientific learning within the context of Islam, none of which are universally accepted.[6] However, most maintain the view that the acquisition of knowledge and scientific pursuit in general is not in disaccord with Islamic thought and religious belief.[1][6]

Therefore, the banning of child marriages as a result of scientific understanding from an Islamic point of view, is completely acceptable."

Every ability these champions use should apply the following effects if you're correct.

Caitlyn / Headshot
&gt;Attacks from brush increase the attack counter by two instead of one.

Draven / Spinning Axe
&gt;Draven's next attack will deal bonus physical damage.

Jarvan IV / Martial Cadence
&gt;Jarvan IV's first attack on a target deals 6 / 8 / 10 % of their current health as bonus physical damage.

Kennen / Electrical Surge
&gt;Every 5 attacks, Kennen will deal extra magic damage equal to a percentage of his attack damage and add a Mark of the Storm to his target.

Lulu / Pix, Faerie Companion
&gt;Pix fires a barrage of 3 bolts, dealing 5 / 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20 / 23 / 26 / 29 magic damage each, at whoever Lulu attacks.

Lulu / Help, Pix!
&gt;Additionally, Pix will then follow and aid their attacks instead of Lulu's for 6 seconds.

Nocturne / Umbra Blades
&gt;Every 10 seconds, Nocturne's next attack strikes surrounding enemies for 120% of his physical damage and heals himself for 10 / 18 / 26 per target hit.

Poppy / Paragon of Demacia
&gt;Upon being hit or attacking an enemy, Poppy's armor and damage are increased for 5 seconds.

Renekton / Ruthless Predator
&gt;Renekton’s next attack will swing twice dealing physical damage and stunning his target for 0.75 seconds.

Shen / Ki Strike
&gt;Every 9 seconds, Shen's next attack will deal bonus magic damage equal to 4 + (6 × level) + (10% of his bonus health).

Sona / Power Chord
&gt;After casting 3 spells, Sona's next attack deals extra 8 + (10 × level) magic damage.

&gt;This enhanced attack has an additional effect depending on which spell was cast last.

Teemo / Toxic Shot
&gt;Additionally, his attacks will poison the target, dealing magic damage each second for 4 seconds.

&gt;This poison will not stack but the duration will be refreshed with every subsequent attack.

Wukong / Crushing Blow
&gt;Wukong's next attack, within 5 seconds, will deal additional physical damage and will reduce the enemy's armor by 30% for 3 seconds.

Xin Zhao / Tireless Warrior
&gt;Xin Zhao is healed for 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 for every 3 attacks that he lands."

31592,,,,,-12,"Here are some fallacies in your argument. 

**Fallacy of Distribution** (composition): where one reasons logically that something true of part of a whole must also be true of the whole.

You assume that because you find a racist picture of Obama created by someone in the Tea Party, the whole Tea Party must be racist. This assumes that picture was made by someone in the Tea Party, but you provided no evidence of this. 

**Base Rate Fallacy**: using weak evidence to make a probability judgment without taking into account known empirical statistics about the probability

Along with

**False Attribution**: occurs when an advocate appeals to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased or fabricated source in support of an argument

That poll you cited from Newsweek is about as credible as the ""proof"" certain individuals put forward proving Obama is a muslim terrorist. 

Also you use too many commas. It makes deciphering your ideas difficult and shows weak command of the English language. If you broke up your paragraphs into shorter, easier to read sentences your thoughts would be more easily understood. "

No. That's not a study guide, that's an open book test you're intended to memorize.

A study guide is a reminder of general topics you've covered up until this point. A sheet of paper that says ""Here's the topics the test will cover. I.E., what we've been doing the last x many weeks.""

It's literally a list of topics, not a rubric of what specifically will be on the test. Which means if you've been paying attention in class, you're 70% of the way there already, just review your notes.

Which to me means that if this teacher didn't cover what was in the study guide in the exam, the exam cover *things she did not teach*.

She can go any day and spent Wed-Fri in extreme pain and discomfort [a whole other story]).

The benefit was yesterday, and the night before it was to take place my father got a phone call from his sister asking if their younger brother, who molested my sister and all of my older cousins (including said-aunt's own children) would be allowed to attend. It goes without saying that my dad (who is currently facing his wife of 40 years impending death, on top of having to hear this horrid request) declined... and was completely disgusted by my aunt's total lack of respect.

(The benefit went fine... he didn't show... and mom is still here at the moment, and finally resting comfortably.)

Except thats usually how the world works, you either do or do not make a choice to help yourself, I'm not saying that these people aren't disadvantaged, quite the opposite,  They definitely deal with adversity, more than others?

&gt;Girls getting pregnant at 14 aren't doing it for the welfare, they're doing it because in their world and their experience of it, the love of a baby is the only validation they can chase after. Boys selling drugs on the corner are out there because their whole lives have been shaped by the expectation that that's all the world has to offer them in the way of a lifestyle where they can achieve anything.

So your saying that most Teen Moms are Teen moms because in the world they live in Teen moms are a common occurence, or that most Kids on the street selling drugs are selling drugs because they don't know anything else? thats all okay because they don't know any better? Bill Cosby is saying that complacency with this mind set is the problem.




&gt;Plus, of course, Bill Cosby is both insulated from the real world of 21st century black people by his wealth and a hypocrite, since he's a rapist.


Semantics, but no, technically speaking Bill Cosby is not a rapist until proven in a court of law, your entitled to your opinion about the allegations, but that doesn't make them fact

As for your question concerning federal involvement: There are many factors here. One, increasing control at the federal level diminishes what Louis Brandeis called ""laboratories of democracy."" Also, it has been the federal government that has driven the emphasis on standardizing tests by tying education funding to them.

This funding model has also increased the bureaucracy placed on schools, superintendents, principles, and teachers. It takes away time from teaching, and adds to the frustration of teachers like Ms. Kohanim.

Now, matts2, I know you enjoy trolling /r/libertarian, though for the life of me, I don't understand why. But I occasionally do take the time to explain things to you, in the off chance you might be sincere with your questions. Your second question—how would we these problems be solved if the federal government got out of education—is a good one, but also one easily answered if you spend a little time looking into the matter. Look at what the federal government has done—taking control away from states and school districts, and mandate standardize testing—and combine that with the frustrations this teacher has had to deal with, and doesn't the question answer itself? 

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you asked this sincerely and are not merely trolling, but I'm not certain you deserve that benefit."

Helps what? Sure, having a sane filesystem is great, but in OSX you never see them. OS X is built over Unix, so it's intrinsically tied to Unix, but doesn't mean you're ""using Unix"". OS X is it's own OS, it's not because it's built over Unix, it's because it's been built, developed and tested by Apple. 

&gt;  it means that there is a lot of open-source software that was written for Linux that you can get to run on OSX. 

I can run *gerbv* on OS X as easily as I can on Linux? I don't get your equation of ""since it's written for Linux, it can run on OS X"". You seem to think that since OS X was written over BSD, that it can run Linux apps. It's not that easy. Open source doesn't mean ""specific for Linux"", it means the source is open to view/alter/edit/redistribute. Apache, Audacity, Gimp, Blender. These are open sourced projects, and are available for both *nix and Windows. 

&gt; What then puts it over the top is that you can then easily test the front-ends of that software in Windows or Linux virtual boxes to ensure cross-system support.

Again, this is not an OS X feature. Maybe if you said, ""You can test front-ends in OS X."" Because that is an OS X specific feature. 

I get you really dig OS X, but you're selling it all wrong. OS X was built over BSD. I have experience with Unix, OS X, and Windows. They all can pretty much do what the other's can, except emulate OS X's graphical environment. The original question was what overwhelming feature of Apple hardware makes Google choose it over PC/*Nix. It's not because of open source software, since they can all run that. It's not because it can run VMs. OS X is what they prefer, visually. It probably helps that their hardware is sexy, too. "

Wolf of Wall Street and Forgetting Sarah Marshall did. Zack and Miri Make a Porno did, if I remember correctly. 

eta: And I wish there was more non-sexual nudity. And less hand-wringing about sexuality in the first place. We shouldn't slap an x-rating on a female orgasm. We shouldn't give something the same rating for boobs as for beheadings. It's stupid. I'm all for nudity being done in a way that isn't objectification of the female body, but I don't think censoring the fact that HEY! underneath our clothes we're all naked people is a helpful way of doing that.

How did the phone company violate the Constitution? I thought the Fourth Amendment only protects you from direct action by the government; if you use somebody else's equipment (e.g., telephone routers), the owner of that equipment can monitor your use of it for any reason they see fit.

Whether *the government* violated the Constitution is an important debate, but I can't see how *the owner of the telephone equipment used* could have violated it by monitoring others' sue of their property (whatever the reason).

I expect I'll be downmodded for this.

Privacy advocates are also concerned at the President's continuation of certain elements of the Patriot Act and his expansion of the CIA's covert drone program, which allows the President to kill anyone (including Americans) anywhere in the world without a trial or public discussion. The President has also done little/less on immigration, climate change/pollution.

Further, Romney supports various elements within the ACA such as caps on lifetime care, and no denying of preexisting conditions) 
* Biggest ""legitimate"" complaints about him - The current complaint is Romney's lack of transparency concerning his wealth and his lack of disclosing his tax forms. Disclosing of tax forms is usually a non-issue, so the fact that Romney isn't releasing more than a years worth of his tax returns is concerning to some Americans. The reality of his returns is somewhere between ""nothing to see here folks,"" and ""this isn't the kind of thing a President should do,"" in terms of how he managed his money. Romney was a half-decent governor in MA, but the areas of his record that many consider good are areas he's tried to distance himself from. His state was first in the nation to allow gay marriage, and his health-care bill in the state has been considered highly successful, and was the model for the Presidents plan. Romney has also been accused of changing his mind (i.e. ""Flip-flopping"") on major issues, sometimes within weeks or hours of taking a specific position. This has raised concerns that we don't know which Mitt Romney America will get if he wins the Presidency.

Edit: For those at work and don't want to grab a link

------------

Dear Daughter,

This is a message for you. And for all of your friends who have become surrogate daughters to me over the last 23 years of your life.

I'd like to chat about Fifty Shades of Grey. And before you get totally creeped out at the concept of me talking about Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, I need you to work with me. Deal?

So the comment I keep hearing from television talk show hosts is, ""You don't want to take your mother to this one!"" I'd just like to just chime in and suggest that the same holds true for every single dad out there. We'll take a pass. You go enjoy yourselves.

With all this movie hype comes a stream of unending conversations about whether this movie is a healthy portrayal of real relationships. My sense is that you're old enough -- and wise enough -- to know the difference between fantasy and reality.

Funny enough, this kind of reminds me of when I was about to head off to college. The big movie that summer was Animal House -- a comedy about the inside world of fraternities. I'll spare you the details but my dad -- Grandpa -- was disgusted by it. Imagine how he reacted when -- in the middle of all the Animal House hype -- I announced that I had pledged Sigma Chi!

Of course, as you know, I had a wonderful experience in the Greek system.

A good reminder that everything on the silver screen isn't an accurate portrayal of reality.

I'm guessing the same will be true for Fifty Shades of Grey. And while I promise you won't see me sitting in the movie theater, I do know what the main storyline is all about. (Don't worry. I'm not going down the S&amp;M path at all). But I will go down the path -- for all you girls in my life -- of reminding you that you should never fall into the trap of thinking you can change a guy. For all your talents, you don't have superpowers. And changing someone -- morphing them into that perfect image you hold in your head -- isn't reality.

It won't happen.

Relationships don't work that way. And guys aren't wired that way. Which brings me to the second thing I want to mention.

Young men -- the guys you know and hang out with -- are an entirely different breed than the generation of men I grew up with. And that's a very good thing.

When I was in those post-college, post-fraternity days, the world said I needed to prove my manliness and strength by getting a good job where I focused on earning a living -- while all the time pretending to be a guy devoid of any nurturing, caring feelings. Well, as you know, that charade didn't last long because I like to think I hit my best fathering stride when I gave myself permission to let you and your brothers experience the real, authentic me. Nurturing and caring all in one package.

What's fantastic is that the guys in your life have been initiated into a world where a man actually shows and reveals his strength by being a person who cares. Studies confirm it -- including a new one from Dove Men+Care, which concluded that 90 percent of men -- globally -- view their caring side as a real sign of their strength. 90 percent!

The image of modern masculinity has evolved. And for me, it feels like it's happened right before my eyes!

I just finished reading a book titled Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men. It's author, Michael Kimmel, made a bunch of interesting points. At the top of his list is the fact that your generation is comfortable with cross-sex friendships. When I read that, I thought about my experience as your dad - and I reflected on how true that is. You -- and all your friends -- have always been comfortable having boys as good friends. And your brothers are the same way with girls. That rarely occurred when I was your age. And I hope you know that I not only think of it as wonderful, I think it's a sign of very positive changes happening in male-female relationships.

So what's my point?

Sweetheart, I just want you to know how lucky you are. You're also living in a time when most men view you as their equal. As they should. You're living in a world where men not only know how to care -- they want to share that quality with you and the people they love. Best yet, they feel really good about that. Which makes me feel really good because I see a world of men with the emotional capacity to be a good partner, friend or what ever it might be for you. And you - each and every one of you -- deserve that.

I know. Dad's babbling.

Go enjoy Fifty Shades of Grey. Thank you for sparing me any of the details.

And just remember, the love of your life will be nothing like Christian Grey.

He'll be better.

I love you kiddo,

Dad

Edit:
I'm in no way condoneing IE 6, 7, or 8. I have done web development, and yes, they are absolutly terrible, and slow to boot. MS is really trying to turn their shit around with their lack luster products like Windows Moble and IE. IE 9 does a comply to standards, as much as Chrome/FF, and it's actually fast, I never thought in a million years I would concider switching from Chrome back to IE, but here I am writing this edit from IE9 (we'll see how long this lasts).

Now... Microsofts marketing is still completely bunk. They're compairing their beta stats/performance/complience to stable builds of FF/Chrome and not their respective beta builds. So, try it for yourself! Download the chrome developer beta, whatever version FF is beta'd at, and IE9. Run them side by side, run the ACID 3 test, run javascript performances tests, run HTML5 demos, you might be suriprised which one you end of favoring.

21161,,,,,-10,"I keep getting dv'd for this opinion but this is the exact reason I was against this idea in the first place.  It's so obviously manufactured to make people lose their shit.  I mean any idiot could see that giving the MOOZLUMS a center right near the grounds of the WTC is guaranteed to hit the Christian-America-Patriotism RAGE button.  The only reason to do such a thing is to create more hatred for Muslims by God-fearin' Christian Patriotic Americans.

I'm personally not against an Islamic center anywhere, but putting it *there* is completely retarded unless you are *looking* for the exact reaction we're seeing.  Just like the South Park thing, it's manufacturing the rage in people by being (what can be considered) ""unreasonably accommodating"" towards Muslims.  The censoring of a cartoon because some nuts beat their chests a little caused everyone to react with a backlash against Muslims.  Putting an Islamic center at the site where people died at the hands of ""OMG-MOOZLUMS-R-TERRRSTS-WTF"" causes people to react with even more anger and hatred and Moozlums-r-taking-over-our-country-we-must-stop-them... ism.

Dragons became more elusive after losing their grip on power.[12] Their numbers dwindled over the years due to many causes: their population in Akavir was wiped out by the Tsaesci, who also brought their onslaught to Tamriel, and the dragons in Vvardenfell were overrun by invading cliff racers.[4] The Akaviri Dragonguard and its successor, the Blades, along with other heroes, hunted dragons and their followers throughout the eras until dragons were nearly extinct.[6][11][13][14][15] Tiber Septim offered those who remained protection in return for their fealty.[2] Despite his pledge, almost all known wild dragons were killed or driven off, disappearing from sight in Tamriel.[11][2]

Some sources claim that all dragons disappeared at once, being devoured by a dragon king or absorbed by Tiber Septim when he ascended to godhood.[2] Many held the belief that the dragons were extinct.[citation needed] This was not true, as live dragons continued to exist throughout the Third and early Fourth Era. The Akatosh Chantry hold dragons as their holy symbol, and keep tamed dragons in their ""sacred grove"".[16][17] Many ancient legends tell of dragons making deals with other races to protect themselves.[6][11][18][19][20] According to Brarilu Theran, at least one dragon is known to have laired in the smoking ruins of Vvardenfell after the Red Year, long after the cliff racers were driven off by Saint Jiub.[21]

&gt;Uuuh, not for a game like this (point and click 2D adventure game).

Says who? The game isn't the product of some small time developer working alone. It has high production values, high profile actors, and high numbers of people working across any number of departments that need to get paid.

&gt;Remember, the initial goal was 400k; he got over 7 times that.

And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. It could very easily be that they planned the game to be much smaller but set a bigger scope once they saw the result of their kick starter. Either way, those people gave their money willingly, and the thing they donated for is nearly finished.

I held them up for my aunt, as a joke of course, ""Hey!  Nunu!  Wanna squeeze those hamhocks into these?""  My mom yelled out something in Spanish to her.  I think basically saying she'd look like a foil wrapped pig?  I don't know.  Something silly.

In my home state of Vermont there is no restriction on carrying a firearm, concealed or not.  In fact no permit is required at all for doing those things or for buying a gun.  We also have PLENTY of drunk, backwoods hick types that play all weekend on their snowmobiles or go fishing/hunting and yet we never have drunken firefights.  Pretty much every firearm offense committed in this state was by a convicted felon who had no right to possess a firearm, and obtained it illegally (usually out of state - despite gunshops on every main street in the state).  We also enjoy the distinction of having the second lowest violent crime rate in the US (last time I checked, anyway).

I'm a hardcore liberal on almost every issue there is, but I have to say - my fellow liberals have got this gun thing all ass-backwards.  They seem to think we need to fix the problem of ""gangstas"" in the cities and drive by shootings by making it ""more illegal"" for them to get guns.  Also when we have a Virginia Tech type of shooting, you react the same way the conservatives do when there's a terror attack.  Instead, consider the big picture:  We really don't have a lot of ""shootouts"" considering how many guns are out there.  They're quite rare.  And like a terrorist attack, there's almost nothing you can do to predict/prevent it.  Something/someone will always slip through the cracks and bomb something or shoot someone.  That sort of shit just *happens*. 

The problem isn't the guns.

::edit::

Just so I'm clear, I will never support a politician solely on this issue.  I think the way its presented by *both* sides is total bullshit, but I don't think its as important as its made out to be.  Still, its a big charade by the ""liberals"" to think that there's some huge problem that needs solving.  Its also a charade by the ""conservatives"" that they're out to protect these rights.  Sure, some will, but some of the front runners in the last election **that had the NRA's endorsement** were demonstrably anti-gun (Guilliani, Romney, etc).  Curiously absent from the NRA's endorsement in the 2008 primaries?  Ron Paul, the only candidate who *truly* supported the second amendment and gun rights.


**tl, dr;**

Guns aren't the issue that they're made out to be.  Your kid is probably not going to be shot up at college or find your gun and kill himself.  On the other hand you're probably never going to experience a home invasion, and your gun **is not** going to protect you from the government.  

Regardless of your side on the gun control issue, you're political party is greatly deceiving you."

If I were making the video with no leashes I would have had Ocean, Yeezy, Jay and Dream inside a church with a bunch of other church goers. Frank is the pastor standing at the booth, Dream is in the choir. During the first hook a group of people in ski masks start killing church goers, you see screaming and falling, dead bodies everywhere. Jay's verse starts, he is sitting at an altar just praying, not moving except for his lips. You see him in fast motion while everything is going to shit around him, dead bodies are falling, bullets fly, people are running and Jay is just sitting there, until his verse ends and he is shot. Now Frank is still at the booth but shot, he has blood on his suit and is bleeding out but is still yelling out the hook, he is shot again and again but doesn't fall until the end of the hook where he falls down but is not dead. Dream appears at the choir, the choir is running up and down and around while he sings his part until he gets shot. Kanye is up now, you see Kanye kill a man, one of the terrorists and everyone points their guns at him. Kanye holds his gun out and starts his verse, by this time there is no shooting just caps of dead bodies and Kanye. He does his verse, when it gets to Girl in all Leopard, you can see that lady next to Kanye's feet. Kanye ends up shooting himself in the head. Now only dead bodies except for Ocean who is still at the preacher booth on his final time just yelling the hook over and over again until he falls dead on his preaching stand. I would do that type of video, though it would be attacked as being blasphemy before I could say potato so that won't happen. There are many ways to interpret this song though so we could both be right."

I read it months ago when it was first published, just like I read the IOM's stuff on Vitamin D when it was first published (I believe in early 2011). I also even read quite a few of the responses to the IOM's findings and the criticisms (the same ones I had).

I was making fun of your use of Google scholar to cherry pick random articles to illutrate a point because it was something you clearly didn't know much about. Pirates and scuvy, lol... 

-------------------

But let's go through the results, shall we.


The very first hit* in *your search* says this:

&gt; Studies indicate that intake of vitamin D in the range from 1,100 to 4,000 IU/d and a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration [25(OH)D] from 60-80 ng/ml may be needed to reduce cancer risk.

Hey, that sounds exactly like what I was saying! Interadasting.

-------------------

But let's take a look at the second hit:

&gt; Three%, 29% and 79% of the population had serum 25(OH)D levels &lt;25, &lt;50 and &lt;80 nmol/L, respectively. 

(nmol/L divided by 2.5 = ng/mL, so 80 nmol/L corresponds to 32ng/mL)

----------

How about that third link:

&gt; Results of secondary analyses in 8 randomized trials showed a slight but statistically nonsignificant reduction in CVD risk (pooled relative risk, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.05]) with vitamin D supplementation at moderate to high doses (approximately 1000 IU/d)

Interesting that 1000IU/d showed a nonsignificant reduction but the 3332IU/d one showed a significant reduction in risk... eh?

-----------------------

The fourth one is regarding the differences in D2 and D3 so let's ignore that for now, but let's take a look at the fifth one (interesting enough it's titled: **A Higher Dose of Vitamin D** Reduces the Risk of Falls in Nursing Home Residents: A Randomized, Multiple‐Dose Study):

&gt; Nursing home residents in the highest vitamin D group (800 IU) had a lower number of fallers and a lower incidence rate of falls over 5 months than those taking lower doses. 

Would you consider 800IU/d (double the DRI) megadosing?

---------------

Number 6:

&gt; Postmenopausal women (N = 36 282) who were enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative clinical trial were randomly assigned to 1000 mg of elemental calcium with 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo for a mean of 7.0 years

&gt; Calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not reduce invasive breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women. 

So the DRI did nothing, but 2000IU/d (""megadosing"") seems to be of benefit in the paper I linked to you previously 

----------------

Number 7 was for a multivitamin which also just happened to include 10ug (400IU) of Vitamin D and found no relationship between Vitamin and Lung Function in the offspring of mothers supplementing (400IU doesn't seem to work well during pregnancy, interesting)

---------

Number 8 isn't an intervention and talking about the problems with a study and it's dosing (I wonder why)... it's also behind a paywall if you don't have university access. It's talking about the problems with #6, by the way.

--------------

Number 9 is titled: Vitamin D Supplement Consumption Is Required to Achieve a Minimal Target 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentration of≥ 75 nmol/L in Older People. I wonder what that means? (75 nmol/L = 30ng/mL)

&gt; Vitamin D status was distributed as follows: 7% (&lt;37.5 nmol/L), 48% (37.5–74.9 nmol/L), and 45% (≥75 nmol/L). 

------------

Number 10 is about infants and:

&gt; Our findings suggest that most US infants are not consuming adequate amounts of vitamin D according to the 2008 AAP recommendation. Pediatricians and health care providers should encourage parents of infants who are either breastfed or consuming &lt;1 L/day of infant formula to give their infants an oral vitamin D supplement. 

Interadasting...

-----------

Number 11 is #6 again

Number 12 is yet another criticism of #6

-------------

Number 13 I linked you to already:

&gt; The results indicate that a vitamin D supplement of 83 μg/d does not adversely affect weight loss and is able to significantly improve several cardiovascular disease risk markers in overweight subjects with inadequate vitamin D status participating in a weight-reduction program.

That's that ""megadose"" of 3332 IU/d, by the way. Interesting how 3332IU/d had a positive impact on markers of health during weight loss but 400IU/d showed no benefit,

----

#14 is another criticism of #6 (or I think it might be a repeat this time, it might #8 again)

I'm getting bored now... but do you see any trends in the literature?

----------

Up to 4000IU/d is *not* considered megadosing by any means. [This search](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22Vitamin+D%22+%22megadose%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=2000&amp;as_vis=0) yields results with supplementation of single doses of 300,000IU or 600,000IU, but I've already talked about how I don't think that's a good idea. The evidence supports that too, but I really don't want to waste any more time on someone as stupid as you as I already have.

-----

No wait, let's go with a few more just for shits and giggles. 

[Here's one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10232622):

&gt; Total-body sun exposure easily provides the equivalent of 250 microg (10000 IU) vitamin D/d, suggesting that this is a physiologic limit.

TIL sun exposure = ""megadosing"" Vitamin D

[Here's another](http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/67/2/373.short):

&gt; Human skin or [3α-3H]7-dehydrocholesterol exposed to sunlight on cloudless days in Boston (42.2°N) from November through February produced no previtamin D3. In Edmonton (52°N) this ineffective winter period extended from October through March. Further south (34°N and 18°N), sunlight effectively photoconverted 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3 in the middle of winter. These results quantify the dramatic influence of changes in solar UVB radiation on cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis and indicate the latitudinal increase in the length of the “vitamin D winter” during which dietary supplementation of the vitamin may be advisable. 

That research is almost 24 years old by the way, and carried out by one of the leading experts on Vitamin D in the world.

To add to the topic, I use my M14 a lot. Do you guys know the M14? It's fucking long and heavy. It's a regular M14.

I always tell the kids starting out to go low with price and to go low with weight.

In the world we live in, people are just discovering that God isn't a real thing and while a vast majority of us might still think that theology is the way to understand the universe, if they could still think after death, they'd be disappointed that they wasted so much time being upset about this stupid shit.

*Edit: I should note that I'm talking about the present day, where the idea of right and wrong doesn't just come from religion*


If you're a Muslim and you're offended, perhaps it's a good idea to rethink what is considered right and wrong in this world, regardless of your religious teachings.


You can stand up for what you believe, but if you do it in a way that harms others, your religion is doing a bad thing for humanity and it's probably better off if it's eradicated.

The Ancients ARE better than Fetishes. For a handful of reasons. First and foremost they're some of the strongest and storied barbarians to have ever lived. For them to have comparable toughness to a dagger wielding, 20lb fetish that can be resummoned with a passive is NOT fair and not a good comparison to make.

With that knowledge in hand, lets talk about summoning pets and using them. WD's have multiple ways to reset their cooldowns and permanent Fetish army is not hard to achieve with the Zuni set, or even just killing fast enough (Grave Injustice). Second, SMK allows them to have 100% Uptime on BBV and FA, while a rare item it exists in live. 

Barbarians on the other hand have a 120 second CD skill that can be reduced by a passive to 90 seconds. On live there is no way to resummon the ancients if they die while COTA is on cooldown, and they do die quite often on live. The reason the ancients perform so well on the PTR is simple. Pets scale with your toughness. My barbarian can achieve 180m+ Sheet toughness, which is then fed through a unity on top of that. It's no surprise that my ancients are far tougher than a WD who has 10-20m sheet toughness. 

Lastly, MANY WD pet builds serve to completely replace the WD in terms of damage output. The WD will just cast support spells and spells to re-summon his pets. It is a full dive pet build. Barbarians have no form of supportable full dive pet build that performs well on live, at all. It's actually a joke. So now that on the PTR the ancients scale with my stats, and deal respectable damage thanks to a massive and unbalanced damage increase from the 6 piece set... players like say it's a pet class. And that, again, is not true. It never will be true. Barbarians are not a pet class and the ancients are not traditional pets like what the WD employs. 

If you want the WD to get stronger and more sustainable/viable full dive pet builds you should provide feedback for that instead of trying to make a poor comparison to a class that varies in basically every way. I mean, hell, on the PTR the ancients are only there to facillitate the damage buff. It's about all they're good for in the majority of a grift. They shine on the RG, but let's be honest... Barbarians have catastrophically shit single target damage. The ancients on the PTR is probably the first time barbs have had good ST Dps in a VERY long time."

The doors open and as they leave the elevator, I say ""Ich spreche Deutsch und Ich habe Sie verstehen."" (I speak German and I understood what you said). Just off the elevator, they briefly turned around to look at me and to this day I've never seen faces so red.

Christianity, 'Christendom', and Europe were also viewed quiet negatively by Muslims for the first thousand years or so of Islam's history.

Therefore - and take this with a grain of salt pending further research - get down on capsaicin rich foods.

&gt;The fact is this - spicier foods can be associated with risk-taking and impulsivity. Two traits of a high-t male which also correlate with assertiveness, leadership and confidence. So even if it doesn't directly raise your T-levels, you'll be taking a small step out of your beta self, and broadening your pallet. If you can handle chilli, you'll be able to dine across a lot of Asia and parts of Africa where they have chilli rich foods.

So you want to improve your testosterone via diet? Here's the quick and dirty.


1: Cut your sugar intake. Aside from the obvious issue of diabetes, issues with low TD are common in the obese. High carb intake increases your insulin production, insulin has been proven to not get along well with TD. And remember, carbs and sugar are the same fucking thing. 2 slices of white bread are nutritionally *worse* for you than a snickers bar- both have about 200 calories to them while the snickers bar at least has some chocolate and peanuts to it. White bread has nothing but lies and wishful thinking. Aim to keep your intake of carbs to less than 100 grams a day. At the moment the only carb-heavy foods I indulge in are fruit (raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, avocado), beans, sweet potatoes, quinoa and steel cut oats.


And mind the dairy intake. Yogurt and cheese are exempt because they have little or *no* lactose in them (remember: stupid fat Americans don't actually like the flavor of yogurt so it gets loaded with sugar, check your labels) but milk is loaded with it.


Compensate that loss of carbs as a staple macro-nutrient with fats. They're more filling and, provided they're from natural sources, even saturated fats have their uses. 



2: Get your zinc. Sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, beef, lamb, lentils, garbanzo beans, cashews, turkey, quinoa, spinach, asparagus, and some mushrooms (crimini, shitake) and shrimp all have zinc in good quantities. Studies have demonstrated direct correlations between zinc intake (and deficiencies) and the quantity of testosterone the male body makes. 


Just remember that zinc isn't water soluble. There *is* no benefit to having too much in your diet, and because your body can't normally dispose of it in quick fashion (water soluble vitamins like C just get peed out when you have too much) what ends up happening is that excess zinc screws with your body's ability to process other micro-nutrients and can help compromise your nervous system. 


3: Weight training. Do it bitch.


4: Get enough vitamin D. It isn't enough to just sit there in the sun- studies have shown that even professional Hawaiian surfers can have D deficiencies. Those of us who don't live in chronically sunny areas or otherwise hate the sun will have to supplement and consume foods rich in D. Eggs are probably the most obvious, but salmon, sardines, and tuna have it too. Shitake mushrooms have trace amounts of it as well. Just remember that if you take a supplement that you want vitamin D3.


Chances are you need vitamin D anyways- fucking no one gets enough and even if you ignore the benefits of TD production, it helps ward off a large number of diseases including diabetes, depression, arthritis and osteoporosis. 



5: Chill the fuck out. No, really, stress has been linked to reduced TD production. 


6: Get enough sleep. I don't think I need to reiterate this point- you can't do anything positive for yourself if you don't regularly get that square 8 hours of sleep. If you physically can't because reasons, anticipate a mid / late afternoon nap.


7: Mind the alcohol intake. 


8: Eat cruciferous veggies. That is, your leafy greens. Spinnach, kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, horseradish, ect. They're rich in a compound called Indole-3-Carbinol, which is a negative regulator for estrogen12- the ""bad"" estrogen hormone that pulls testosterone from your body. 



So it isn't entirely inaccurate to say that spicy foods help with TD production- horseradish and wasabi *do* contain compounds that reduce a hormone that saps testosterone from your body. I just find it *incredibly* unlikely you're ever going to get enough of either of those things to make it matter. "

The cost of freedom of expression? There's no cost to freedom of expression, its freedom of expression ON THE INTERNET, and even then, you can host it yourself, you can run it not for profit, you can not use credit card processors, or ad networks, and SOPA can't fucking touch you. Get off your high fucking horse.

Those politicians provided the funding for the internet, so they get to decide how it works, and when there are rules.

Show me an example of a lawsuit where it was a legitimate original content? The majority of lawsuits are simply how corporations get justice for wrongs. In kindergarden you tell the teacher or, man up and take care of it yourself, when you're an adult, you file a lawsuit. Just because someone is poor it doesn't absolve the fact they may have caused you harm.

Subvert and extend copyright law? Its original use was to stop unauthorized copies of books when the printing press was invented. In my opinion, if real property rights are indefinite, so should intellectual property rights.

Oh, lets just scope creep over to kleptocrats — its not like Google, Facebook, etc... aren't run by the latest generation of kleptocrats. Lets just ignore that.

I'm a producer and I hope you get put down. The internet is incapable of figuring out how to monetize content because everyone on it has gotten used to it being free.

Don't get pissed off at us because we have a working model based on artificially restricting access to our content, why don't you figure out your own solutions. Are you scared that one day millions of people will wake up and realize they need to get paid for their fucking cat videos? That every tweet is worth money to someone, and they should be getting some of that fucking cash?

What then? What will twitter and facebook do? What will Google do when the paradigm shifts that it has to pay a licensing fee to index the NY Times?

Please, please tell me where we're failing as businesses — we're succeeding despite this insane demand on our cost structures — despite this anti-social element attempting to steal our content for free.

Each of those kids on the internet, yeah, they're a potential one of those. And just like in the real world, only 1 in a million of them has the fucking chops to make a 200mm movie which half a billion people want to see.

What's funny is I'm probably close to your age, but what you don't realize where your headed, is to a life of poverty, a life where you can't make any money, where the money goes to the VC firms and a few coders who got lucky with an idea.

But thats fine — I'm doing great, laws will pass to protect me, and in the meantime I'll make do, but when all is said and done, I'll laugh as your impoverished and spent carcass is spit out by your precious internet to make room for the next 15 year old kid with an iMac and a pirated copy of protools.

Long story short, NHL rules limit how much the blade of a stick can curve.  A lot of players played with illegal sticks.  A team can accuse a player of using an illegal stick during the game, which would result in a 2 minute penalty for the player if true.  If the stick is found to be legal, it's a 2 minute penalty for the accusing team.

Late in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals with the Kings up by a goal and about to take a 2-0 series lead on the road, the Canadiens accused Marty McSorley of having an illegal stick.  He did, the Canadiens got a power play, tied the game, won in overtime, and then won the next three games and the Stanley Cup.

At the Canadiens' arena the visiting team's sticks were kept in a hallway outside the locker room, and it is alleged that a trainer for the Canadiens measured the Kings' sticks during Game 1 so they'd know who was using illegal sticks.  They saved that information until a critical moment to get an important player off the ice and have a power play.  "

If you read the white paper there is nothing to say that the NHS is being privatised, the informed concern is that it could lead to it in the future - but then they capped the number of private patients they can care for and raised the ceiling on how much they can charge them.  Insurance will actually get more expensive, NHS hospitals with a duty to provide NHS care, will have more money.  

[2]  In the same time-frame no private contractor will hold a warrant card.

[3]  They ran on a platform of cutting the jobs of bureaucrats.  They ran on a platform of firing people.

[4]  Everybody knew they would raise taxes.  They ran on a platform of austerity and reform and tackling the debt.  People knew it had to happen.

[5]  If you thought they were going to tackle austerity without touching welfare you were insane.  They specifically announced what would be ring fenced.  Welfare wasn't in it.

[6]  Everybody knew they would raise tuition fees.  On day one of the government David Davis one of the most prominent Conservatives refused to take a cabinet position on this very basis.  Everybody knew what Davis had done and why - nobody was surprised that tuition fees were being increased.

[7]  David Cameron put Vince Cable in charge of the select committee overseeing the BSkyB bid and he would have known full well his feelings on Murdoch.  Cameron effectively left Murdoch out to hang without getting any blood on his hands. Every Prime Minister in the last 30 years has had a link to or with Rupert Murdoch.  You meet the man that owns half the press.  This one just happens to ride at the same stables as the husband of one of the editors.  So what?

I usually have to cover the bed with 4 towels to keep everything from getting soaked.  Sometimes it still gets on the sheets (I have a plastic mattress cover to keep my mattress protected).

Yes she is ejaculating and no it is not urine.  As a student of Biology and a woman who squirts I've done a lot of research on this topic.  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/vbm44/advice_on_squirting/c533z4k) is a post I wrote that explains the physiology of the g-spot and female ejaculation in layman's terms.

Need more evidence this wasn't urine?  Have some links to peer reviewed scientific studies about this process.

* The components of female ejaculate when compared to urine show that ejaculate contains several components not found in urine including: fructose, glucose, prostate specific antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase. Ejaculate also contains lower levels of creatinine and urea then urine. [Source](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498809551431)

*  Another study comparing pre-orgasmic urine and female ejaculate from participants showed this same difference in fluid composition. Perineal ultrasounds identified a prostate stucture of millions of small glands and ducts surrounding the urethra (the urethral sponge).

*  In this study methylene blue dye was used to color urine in the bladder and it was observed in the urine but not in the orgasmic expulsion. [Source](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498109551093)

As someone who is an experienced squirter I tend to find I still soak the towels even if I've just peed, and if I didn't pee before sex I can squirt all over the bed and I'll still have to pee afterwards.  The components of female ejaculate are chemically different then urine which is why it doesn't smell like urine and why it is clear in appearance whereas urine is yellow."

/u/MikeGerics thinks every other team wants to suck each other off during foul discussions but everyone's been trying to say that UNCW just makes bad calls and doesn't engage in the comraderie shared by the majority of the ultimate community. This oftentimes throws people off but isn't an issue. It's the fouls calls that are the bad spirit. 

Now, for actual comments on UNCW's play and possibilities at Nationals, my understanding is that they rely heavily on one player and that's not a functional strategy for any tema tht wants to bring home some hardware from Natties. It's really easy for teams that have more depth in their play making to rotate through 1-2 of their top defenders and just reduce that X-man to uselessness. Alah, Dylan Freechild the last two years in Semis. In 2013 Trent Dillon just shut Freechild down in the grand scheme of Ego's reliance on him and in 2014 Stanley Peterson's coverage of Freechild and Ego's youth showed that they were only able to go as far as Freechild could carry them.

That's all I can conclude because I've not been able to watch much of Wilmington's play from this year. If they're legit and have the firepower to win they will."

&gt;""It followed us during half of our orbit. We observed it on the light side, and when we entered the shadow side, it disappeared completely. It was an engineered structure, made from some type of metal, approximately 40 meters long with inner hulls. The object was narrow here and wider here, and inside there were openings. Some places had projections like small wings. The object stayed very close to us. We photographed it, and our photos showed it to be 23 to 28 meters away.

&gt;[...] Many cosmonauts have seen phenomena which are far beyond the experiences of earthmen. For ten years I never spoke on such things. [...] It only flew straight, but then a kind of explosion happened, very beautiful to watch, of golden light. This was the first part.

17473,,,,,19.0,"**Everything below is purely from personal anecdote, and it in no way reflects (or should reflect) the many international asian students at UofT (there are some really great people).**

&gt;How do you feel about Asians now, compared to before?

Outside of school nothing has changed. I'm still close with all my Asian friends from before UofT and I've made many new ones, and my public interactions (excluding UofT) are still the same; I treat everyone equally and with the same level of respect. But when I'm at school, man, it's the worst.

Basically, having to deal with all the Asian internationals in my department over the last five years has made me a bitter person. I have, to date, never had a positive experience with any of them. I may be like this now, but first year me wasn't. I didn't care where they were from. Actually I did, but only in the context of wanting to learn more about them and their culture. I tried making friends with them but they didn't seem interested.

I want to stop here and point out that I understand how intimidating it must be to be living by yourself for the first time in a foreign country where you don't speak the language very well. I get it. I would probably stick to people of my own culture too. So I don't blame them for not wanting to be friends, or at least not reciprocating due to timidness (someone once explained to me that this is a common reason, can't speak for it's accuracy though).

The first time my view started to shift was probably during APS111 and APS112. For those that don't know, these are two courses all engineers take first year where they put you in groups of 4-6 to work on an engineering project (the communication side of it anyway). For both these courses I was the only non-international non-Asian in my group. Since I was the only native English speaker I was elected leader both times. And both times I had to put up with the same BS:

- Not showing up to meetings (some of which were with real clients that had volunteered there time for the university).
- Constantly speaking to each other in mandarin during our meetings.
- Sending out group correspondences in mandarin.
- Not being able to write anything intelligible (okay, I get this one, but shouldn't you be able to properly read and write in English before you decide to attend an English-speaking university?).
- Disappearing during deadlines, thus leaving me no choice but to do their parts, then showing up hours before the deadline with a half-assed Google-translated piece of shit and expecting me to swap it in and credit them for the assignment.

Okay, things are getting out of hand. Let's move on.

In second year things weren't so bad. No randomly assigned groups. But I started spending a lot of time in the computer lab, and as anyone in engineering can tell you it's just a constant myriad of people shouting in mandarin. There's really no reason for me to care about this at all, and frankly I didn't. But over the years I've slowly formed a Pavlovian response of instant annoyance to any mandarin I hear. Also many of them don't clean up after themselves. Like spills and food packaging everywhere. I've been told this might just be a cultural thing, but dammit it's been four years and nothing's changed.

I kept my distance for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year so everything's been chill, but the small little annoyances were still there. Actually, my prejudice might have highlighted and amplified these annoyances out of proportion, I do not deny that possibility.

PEY (year long internship for those those unaware) was a return to dealing with shit from first year. All the other interns working along side me were international Asians. Shit was the worst. They couldn't keep the shared workspace clean, kept losing things, and were pretty much incompetent even though they had the same amount of training and schooling as me. I had to pick up so much of the slack that I was spending an extra 9-15 unpaid hours a week at work. I talked to the higher ups and they really didn't care (funny though how they always came to me first when work needed to be done). I basically put up with this for 16 months since I wanted a good recommendation (and yes, it did pay off :D).

But to answer your question:

&gt;May I ask how UofT has made you more prejudiced?

Basically having them be a constant source of stress and annoyance (even though I've only interacted with so very few of them) in my life since I entered UofT.

I accept that my prejudice is wrong, and I'm not looking for any validation (actually I'd be a little troubled if I received any). I want to work past it, but I don't think that will happen till I leave this place. I'm sorry if I've offended anyone, it was not my intention."

Articles like this making front page reflects poorly on the reddit community because they are **Tea Party-Level Tarded**.  A very small amount of research (i.e. googling Andrew Maguire) is required for the real story to present itself. 

Why is this article's best source of information itself? Dig at the author: Michael T Snyder trafficks in fear. Look at his blog. 

http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/

Michael T Snyder wants to blame the CFTC for the indiscretions of private investors. If he were at all interested in supporting the whistleblower, he'd be sticking to the facts and telling you how the CFTC should be responding to this situation: not condemning them.

http://www.sott.net/articles/show/205674-Andrew-McGuire-whistle-blower-on-market-manipulation-injured-in-hit-and-run-accident

This is a much better article. It contains Andrew McGuire's letter, it tells us when the information came to light, and it gives us more of an idea of what the CFTC's role is in regulating the market, and how much influence it actually has. Note that when the whistleblower was revealed, the CFTC was in the middle of a meeting about establishing regulations to limit maximum holdings on precious metals, in order to prevent the sort of thing TFA is supposedly worried about.

Fortunately for the CFTC, they are currently in the process of a lot of restructuring thanks to Obama. Under previous presidential appointees, they were so mismanaged that there were people all over the country not doing their jobs. Now, they're re-evaluating their surveillance offices and making staffing changes with the intent of getting people who know what the hell they're doing on the job. 

You can't fix two decades of bustedness in a government entity overnight, but rest assured, this process is already well underway.

The sad part is, anything the CFTC restricts will end up not making an impact. Trading restricted in the US will just move overseas to places where it isn't restricted. 

Ultimately, the best way to invest safely is to invest in markets with which you are very familiar. If you're worried about gold investments because you think they aren't going to be safe, go find something you find comfortable instead."

My name is sprinter_eight_six, and I live in Mrs. Chow’s riding, at (somewhere or the other).  Last night I read a Globe and Mail article that thoroughly disgusted me.  Public safety minister Vic Toews believes that, if I have a problem with the government forcing my internet provider to log my personal details, without a warrant or even reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing on my part, then I must either be a child pornographer, or in support of child pornographers.

I find that to be a sickening false dichotomy, and beneath the intelligence or decorum of an elected official.  I don’t support this bill because Section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms specifically guarantees my right against such a bill passing.  I’m not willing to give up my constitutional rights on the basis of what Mr. Toews does or does not believe.  

I hope you will do the right thing and not only oppose this bill, but speak forcefully for all Canadians who are sick of this government’s repeated attempts to encroach on our personal information.  Thanks for taking this message.

31431,,,,,68,"Well, I can do a factor analysis.

Two common factors were identified. The first encompasses IQ, Poverty, Murder, Theft and Religiousness, all of which were highly intercorrelated. The second factor was Generosity and Divorce, which were not correlated with the other measures.


When I remove Divorce and Generosity from the analysis, IQ is the largest single factor (i.e. IQ has the highest correlation and predictive value over all of the other variables). The loading factor for IQ was 0.87 overall. Poverty had the second highest loading at 0.75, and all of the other loadings were medium strength (~0.6) except for conservatism and divorce (~0.4).


It's important to note that this doesn't mean IQ causes the others. It accounts for the most variance in the other scores and lower IQ is probably a large predisposition to engage in criminal activity and religion, but since all of the factors were highly intercorrelated there's probably a strong interaction (That is, environments where murder, poverty and theft are more common also lead to lower standardized test scores)."

False, no such bracelets exist, and every euthanasia case must start with a request from the patient. The family nor the doctor can initiate the procedure, which has very clear rules: 

* the patient's suffering is unbearable with no prospect of improvement

* the patient's request for euthanasia must be voluntary and persist over time (the request cannot be granted when under the influence of others, psychological illness or drugs)

* the patient must be fully aware of his/her condition, prospects and options

* there must be consultation with at least one other independent doctor who needs to confirm the conditions mentioned above

* the death must be carried out in a medically appropriate fashion by the doctor or patient, in which case the doctor must be present

* the patient is at least 12 years old (patients between 12 and 16 years of age require the consent of their parents)

**10% of all deaths are from euthanasia**

False.

That is 2,3%. Of course not every case will be reported, but I assume most of them will, because when a doctor does not follow the guidelines that have been set in Dutch law for euthanasia (including reporting it to  a review committee), it is still illegal, so that would be a huge risk to take for the doctor.


**Elderly people in the Netherlands don't go the hospital, they go to another country, because they're afraid, because of budget purposes, that they will not come out of that hospital**

While it is true that a growing number of people go to Belgian and German hospitals for non-urgent treatments, this is because of the shortage in healthcare professionals in the Netherlands, because of the population ageing, resulting in waiting lists in Dutch hospitals. This is still a fairly small amount, around 2% of operations on Dutch patients is done in foreign hospitals. But it certainly has nothing to do with 'budget purposes'. The Netherlands is in the top20 for both [life expectancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) and on the [WHO ranking of healthcare systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_healthcare_systems), well above the US, which I assume would be harder if we were just killing old people left and right."

Not only did I not make that claim, but flip a switch? The civil rights act was 50 years ago. Tons of strides have been made since then.

&gt; What's more, an argument often made specific to football is that a team is purely motivated by what helps them win. That's the biggest joke of all.

What? Of course they're motivated to win. Especially the owners. Owners own a team because it makes money. You know what makes more money and grows a brand? Winning.


TL;DR: The basis for your argument hinges on the fact that owners are majority white and thus somehow that makes it harder for blacks to get jobs, despite the % of black HCs being higher than the % of blacks in America"

There are currently 31 GPS satellites in orbit around the Earth.  They constantly broadcast a message, the two most important parts of which are:

* the time the message was transmitted
* precise orbital information

Using its own very precise clock, your GPS device is thus able to calculate how far away each GPS satellite is.  Distance = velocity * time; here, velocity is the speed of light, and time is the difference between your GPS device's timestamp and the timestamp on the message sent by the satellites.

Now, if there was only one GPS satellite, it wouldn't be very helpful, because you'd only know you were, say, 104 meters away from the satellite.  There's an infinite number of points exactly 104m away from the satellite; it's described by a sphere around the satellite 104m in radius.

So to get a GPS lock, you need contact with at least 4 GPS satellites.  With two GPS satellites, their spheres will intersect and produce a circle of possible points.  The third GPS satellite intersects with that circle and produces two possible points.  Theoretically this should be enough, because only one point will be anywhere near the Earth's surface.  But the clocks on your device and on the GPS satellites aren't 100% perfectly accurate; even the tiniest imprecision in timing introduces massive errors in calculating distance.  (This is also why GPS has to consider relativistic effects.)  So you use a 4th GPS satellite, which both nails down your exact location and also happens to help correct your device's clock (which is presumably usually less precise than the GPS satellites' clock).

GPS is also used as a way for scientists and engineers to get a cheap, portable, and reliable source of extremely accurate time.  This is because you can run the GPS formula backwards; if you have a fixed, planted receiver that you know the exact location of, you can use that same GPS signal as a way to calculate your current time extremely precisely.  Figure out where each GPS satellite is, and then calculate how long it should have taken each signal to get to where you are.

Much more actually goes on in GPS than this brief summary.  For instance, the military developed the technology and originally had the GPS satellites introduce some random error into their signals, error that only the U.S. military could adjust for.  This was intended to give the U.S. a military advantage in times of conflict and prevent enemies from using our GPS.  In 2000, Clinton eliminated this fuzziness, as the military had developed alternative (still highly classified) methods of denying GPS service to adversaries on a regional basis.  As a result, other countries (Russia, China, Europe) are now beginning to launch their own global navigation satellites, since the U.S. can quite literally deny GPS signal to any country at any time.

The real takeaway is that in many ways, GPS represents the ultimate culmination of all of humanity's technological and scientific achievements.  I am consistently amazed that we can take such incredible technology, stick it in a portable device we carry in our pockets, *and no one even really cares about it*.  "

Is not legally relevant as it is not illegal to follow someone you believe is about to commit a crime.
2. Zimmerman claims he lost sight of Martin and was leaving when Martin re-appeared and initiated the confrontation. This is an issue of fact. We do not know this to be true.
3. We do not know that he had no reason to be suspicious. In fact, there is some evidence he did have reason to be suspicious given the history of recent burglaries and his unfamiliarity with Martin. His anger or hate toward someone he believed to be a criminal is irrelevant. You seem to be adopting the ""racist watchdog"" angle, but there's not much support for that. Also Zimmerman is Hispanic, not White, which undercuts the ""white v. black"" theory.

4666,,,,,260.0,"Breastfeeding is, by far, the best thing you can feed your baby, and it's something I looked forward to during my pregnancy. My little one was born on time, but she inhaled some meconium, and she ended up in the NICU for just over two weeks. I faithfully pumped every 3 hours, and brought my milk to the NICU, but I never, ever caught up to her needs. I was never, no matter what I tried, how often I pumped, or how many lactation specialists I saw, was able to provide more than 50% of her food, and as she grew, my supply didn't seem to pick up at all, and by the time she was 2 months old, I was only making about 20% of what she ate, and after her second round of vaccines, I gave up.

And that's when the comments from others started. 

Did you know that strangers on the street are perfectly willing to walk up to you while you're mixing up a bottle for your baby and tell you that you're a bad parent for not breastfeeding? Because they are. Quite a few of them. 

Just a few days ago, I was at a mall, and my daughter decided she was hungry. I found a bench, mixed a bottle for her, and began feeding her. I was approached by an older couple who had been watching me from a few benches over, and after the obligatory compliment about how beautiful the baby is, the man said ""It's just a shame you decided breastfeeding was too inconvenient for you."" The woman followed it up with ""I breastfed my children until they were a year old. It was time consuming, but that's what breasts are for!"" Rather than explain myself again, and have to hear ""Oh, you just weren't doing it right!"" from another fucking stranger, I just said ""I'm sure that was nice for you. My daughter is adopted.""

And that's fucked up. It really is. I shouldn't have to justify what I'm feeding my child to anyone. I would love to wake up every morning and breastfeed my daughter. The reality is that it's not possible for all women, and it's no one's fucking business whether I'm feeding my kid enfamil or breastmilk. 

Breastmilk is perfect. It's portable. There's no packing bottles, water and formula. There's no walking downstairs to the kitchen to make a bottle at 3 in the morning. There's no expensive formula to buy. And best of all, it's 100% perfect food for your child. 

But please, for the sake of her sanity, don't judge the mother you see feeding her child formula. You just don't know why she's doing it. "

#**Classturbation**
First I present a classy way to fap. 
    
Get naked aside a wll-fitted smoking jacket. Turn on classical music of your choice, like Mozart or perhaps something of the Baroque era. Load up some black-and-white pornography on mute [(TheDudeaBides96 reccommends this)](http://video.xnxx.com/video489787/very_early_vintage_porn_-_1915). When you fap keep a pinky extended at all times. When you ejaculate make sure you utter an elegant phrase; for instance: ""Well this is rather delightful.""
    
#**ANGER FAPPING**
This is a special type of fapping, saved only in a mood of extreme anger. Note that multiple media sources are recommended to fully enjoy such blissful orgasm such fapping can generate.
    
In the background you need a television. Turn on a channel showing a *Will and Grace* rerun, or if you're really in the mood *Fox News*. Pull up your ex's pictures on Facebook,save them, then select the option to view them in slideshow mode. Use a tube of Icy Hot as lubrication and put some kosher salt on the head. Hit play, turn up the TV and fap with vigor.
    
#**Reverse Stranger Fapping**
Most of us know the technique where you sit on your arm to make it numb so you can get the impression of some touching you. Today I'll show you the reverse.
    
First you need one or more copies of the Encyclopedia Britannica or similar hardbound encyclopedia. Alternatively if you want to finally make that copy of Atlas Shrugged useful, you may use that (NOTE: Atlas Shrugged may also be in the ANGER FAPPING variation)

Place your erect penis on a waist high surface such as a desk. Press down your book on the penis. Go gently at first, then get firmer and firmer until you get numb.
    
Remove the book and quickly sit down and fap. You will only feel sensation in the nerve endings in your palms, not your penis. Enjoy the feeling of jerking off a random stranger.

##BONUS **The Humphrey Bogart**

What better way to fap than to pay tribute to a cinema legend?

This kind of fapping can only be done at night. First, pull your Venetian blinds down, then open them just enough so the slants of moonlight fall on you as you fap. Your fapping area must give the impression of a dimly lit film noir set.

Get naked, but keep a fedora on. Turn on the famous *As Time Goes By* song from Casablanca.

Now, before you begin fapping narrate the experience. For example, you may say, ""With the onset of the 21^st century, many eyes in imprisoned America turn hopefully, or desperately, toward the freedom of the internet... here viewed by the hungry eyes of one such gentleman... sitting contemplatively in front of his computer screen, turgid penis in hand..."" etc.

Begin to fap, carefully dangling a cigarette from your fapping hand. When you come, ejaculate into a wide-brimmed cocktail glass. Hold the glass up for a toast and say ""Here's to you, kid""

#**Inception Fapping**
If there is one thing lacking in the fapping technique of today's youth, it is imagination. Not to worry, for Inception fapping lets you go layers deeper than ordinary fapping methods.

You will need a camera or webcam connected to your computer. Sit in front of your computer screen. Position the camera on a steady surface behind you, facing the screen from over your shoulder. Now load the application that shows what your camera is recording. It should be a clear view of your head, back, and fapping arm. If not, adjust as required so you can see this as well as the computer screen.

Begin fapping. If you have placed the camera correctly you should be watching yourself fapping to a video of yourself fapping to a video of yourself fapping to a video of yourself fapping to a video of yourself fapping, and so on until infinity.

[It's a fap within a fap](http://inception.davepedu.com/inception.mp3)

#**Hot Dog Fapping**
A very aesthetically pleasing flap.

You will need a hand-towel. Soak it first to give it some moisture to make your fapping experience more comfortable.Fold it in half and roll it to form some sort of tube.

Place your penis inside the tube leaving an inch or so space between the two rolled ends. If an inch of the top of your penis isn't fully visible, roll again or use a smaller towel.

Now load up some porn. I recommend videos like this http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=255263646 to give you the impression that you are having a fun day watching some baseball, or a similar venue in which hot dogs are commonly sold.

Grab the towel steadily around your penis. Grab a pump-bottle of Vaseline and gently squeeze a wavy line of lotion along that one inch exposed. This should hopefully make the apparatus look like a delicious hot dog covered in mustard. Fap into the towel."

Title: Growing Up

Lyrics:

Today is a good day to party

Call up my best friend Marty

We dance all night and drink fine wine

All night long we have a good time

.

But then I see a beautiful girl

She's the most beautiful in the world

I think I'm in love with her

We're gonna live together forever

.

**Chorus**

Maybe I'm growing up

Maybe I'm growing up

I think I'm growing up

Yeah baby I'm growing up

.

And baby we'll be happy all day

I'll get a job and get good pay

Because I want to marry you

We'll have kids, maybe two

.

*And so forth about mundane things.*

The keys themselves were not stolen, the keys were perfectly fine, but they were purchased with stolen CCs, and then re-sold to the players.

When the CC owner realized they've been victim of fraud they made a chargeback. Ubisoft detected the chargebacks and said ""we no longer have your money, you no longer have the game"".

--------------

The data clearly shows that when western influence takes hold, and education spreads, the society becomes less barbaric and more tolerant. But there's only so far the religion is able to be bent toward tolerance. Even very exposed cultures like Egypt and Paakistan are hotbeds of horrible beliefs.

Average US / Canadian Muslims are likely just as appalled by extremists as the average US Christian is by Westboro or the KKK. But worldwide, the average Muslim may dislike Suicide Bombing, but their morals leave a lot to be desired. These are not, by and large, cultures any progressive or liberal should be praising.

So the way I see this comic as most unfair is that it isn't inclusive enough... Yesterday the Pope came out as a one of the smiling muggers..."

32151,,,,,128,"I had a run in with a school shooting situation as well.  Back in 2008 I was a sophomore at Northern Illinois University.  I was walking to one of my blow off classes a little late as usual.  As I walked in a guy from the class over started yelling about a shooting on campus and that we had to evacuate.  Some people started freaking out, my buddy and I instantly started joking about it being some gang related incident, which wasn't uncommon in DeKalb. 

The teacher told us to go home, instead of staying in the classroom and locking the doors like we should have done.  At this time no one really knew the severity of the situation at hand.  People started flooding the hallways, as I pushed myself through the crowd and outside I saw people running from Cole Hall, which was right in front of Dusable (where my class was.) I've never seen a war or a horrible car wreck or anything that resembles a tragedy.  

The first thing I heard was glass shatter from the force of someone slamming through the exit doors, the next was blood curdling screams of the people injured.  I saw two huge football players carrying a girl from the building with buck shot in her leg.  I saw a girl I knew from the frats covered from head to toe in blood yelling for someone to help her boyfriend inside.  

I dropped my backpack and helped the football players carry the injured girl away from Cole Hall and back in to Dusable.  The NIU police were incredibly fast to respond and were on the scene in minutes.  The ambulances however were quite slower.  

As we set the girl down in Dusable zounds of people came from all directions to get a chance to see the wounded girl. I yelled for someone to call 911, but the towers were being bombarded by calls no one could get through.   She was crying her eyes out and yelling through the sobs.  I took off my Northface and threw it over her for a blanket because she was shaking uncontrollably.  Luckily a police officer and EMT came moments later en route to Cole Hall.  They worked quickly to put pressure on her wounds.  A few minutes later an ambulance pulled up in the top turnaround of Dusable.  They had her on a stretcher in seconds and then she was gone.

It all happened so fast no one had time to think about what was happening, we just did what we could do.  I picked up my blood stained Northface and walked back to Cole Hall to see if I could be of any help.  The place was packed with police and EMT's.  Helicopters were flying over head and the wind they produced was freezing so I draped my Northface over me.  

A policeman saw my coat and ran up to me to see if I was OK, I told him as quickly as I could that it wasn't mine and that I didn't need help.  He told me to clear the area with the rest of the people.  So I did.  

Craziest part about this is that when I was walking to Dusable I passed through the back of Cole Hall.  I remember seeing a guy pacing back and forth outside the entrance to Cole Hall.  He was wearing all black and I remember thinking to myself something about how I hated theater kids.  I was one of the last people to see that man alive without a gun in his hand.

My previous job title was Mortgage Counselor for a non profit organization that was took calls through the hopeline (1.888.995.HOPE) in which I worked for over 4 years when the housing market was beginning to slide.
Let me begin by stating that I can understand how difficult of a time this must be for you especially given that you provide for 3 children.  I am going to write a briefing here, but if you have any questions for me feel free to ask away as I will do whatever I can to make sure that you go through this with an  understanding of your options and the pros and cons of each.
As others have stated, I would be very cautious about using the 401k for various reasons... It should be a last resort and you should know what you are getting into.  Withdrawing early will lead you to pay penalties(30% sounds about accurate) but another thing you should know is that if you still have a balance on your mortgage loan, paying off 2/3s or 3/4s or whatever it amounts to will not lower your monthly payments.  What I am saying here is that it would be a shame to withdraw your entire 401k to pay off 100k and still owe 30 or so.  It will not put you in a position to refinance as you are currently unemployed and you could still lose the house to foreclosure if you fail to continue with the payments even after reducing the overall balance.
Your best bet if you plan to keep the house is to either find good tenants that will cover the mortgage and keep your property in good standings... Air on the side of caution, perform background checks or at least tell prospective tenants that you plan on a background and credit check as this will likely scare off prospective bad tenants from even trying to rent your property.
Seek out employment(I'm actually assuming that you are) and if you have to take a lesser job with lesser pay in order to provide for your family than there may still be a chance at working out a loan modification to change the terms of your loan and retain ownership.
Other things to consider are just straight selling the home.  I am unsure if you have any equity in your home at the moment or if it would be considered underwater, meaning that you owe more that the current market value of the home.  Either way selling the home is not a horrible option, though difficult when you have kids enrolled in school and such.  If you have equity, then selling the home can allow you seed money to float you while you seek employment and a rental property to keep a roof over your head.  If you owe more than the home is worth, than you can attempt a short sale of the home(alerting your mortgage company of your financial hardship and listing the home with a realtor for short sale purposes) doing this does 2 things, shows your lender that you're willing to work with them thus sometimes stalling foreclosure processes if and/or when you fall behind on payments.  Also, many lenders offer relocation assistance upon successful completion of a short sale.

Sorry for the long post as I just wanted to put as much info out there that I can fit, but again, if you have additional questions I am happy to help.  You can also call 888.995.HOPE for free and discuss your situation in detail with a counselor... Bear in mind that they will put together a report to send your lender after you talk with them so if you don't want your lender to know about this yet, make sure to inform the counselor that you do not wish for them to send your lender any information regarding your conversation until you have discussed all options with your family 1st."

Title: Growing Up

Lyrics:

Today is a good day to party

Call up my best friend Marty

We dance all night and drink fine wine

All night long we have a good time

.

But then I see a beautiful girl

She's the most beautiful in the world

I think I'm in love with her

We're gonna live together forever

.

**Chorus**

Maybe I'm growing up

Maybe I'm growing up

I think I'm growing up

Yeah baby I'm growing up

.

And baby we'll be happy all day

I'll get a job and get good pay

Because I want to marry you

We'll have kids, maybe two

.

*And so forth about mundane things.*

At first I thought it would fun, getting to be around guitars all day, and talk music with fellow musicians.  Turns out I was wrong, that 10-hour shifts 5-6 days a week while listening to slighty-too-loud overhead music and 14-year-olds play the first 5 bars of ""Crazy Train"" over and over and over again wasn't actually all that great.  But I stuck it out, I needed money and I have one of those ""don't quit ever"" attitudes.

When I got hied, the store was in serious trouble.  They had recently fired a huge chunk of the staff for skimming profits nd selling pot out of the warehouse.  Their numbers were really low, and corporate as breathing down their necks.  But, as it turns out, I have a penchant or selling stuff that I know about.  I was the accessories guy, and got really, really good at it.  I was routinely rolling $30k or better a month out the door, and the most expensive thing I had in my department was only $500.  I also had one of the lowest return rates on the west coast, and a file with several letters from happy customers saying how much help I had been.  Eventually, the store's numbers improved, especially my department.  Eventually, we were #1 for our district, and #3 on the west coast, behind Hollywood and San Francisco.

However, NONE of that mattered to the GM or anyone from corporate.  All they wanted was more from me.  My numbers had to be better every month, or I'd get yelled at.  I was written up for having a low sales month one January because I went on vacation.  I would get daily emails and phone calls from the district and regional managers, demaning to know why I hadn't hit $xxxx in sales yet.  My hours got bumped up to the point where my days consisted of sleeping, showering, eating, and working.  I had zero social life.  My gf at the time would go weeks without seeing me.  Eventually, because of the stress, I developed a ulcer.  So I decided to quit.

I threw myself into my last month, which just happened to be December, the month all retail workers hate.  I worked extra hours, sold as much as I could, contacted old customers, you name it.  Blew everyone out of the water, rolling just shy of $80,000 in gear. My boss called me in to his office, and said I was doing a good (not great, good) job, and to keep it up.  I pointed to the sales numbers screen, pointed out how well I had been doing and how well liked I was by the customers, and asked for a raise.  He laughed and said no.  So I handed him my resignation letter.  2 weeks later I was done and starting classes in college, something I'd had to put off since work wouldn't allow me to cut hours for school.

I came back to the store a couple months later, as someone who had worked with me called and said they'd found a jacket of mine in the warehouse.  When I showed up, the GM wasn't there.  I asked, and what I wastold was that apparently, corporate HAD noticed me, and when my GM had failed to retain me, they'd fired him.  Also, that department went from #1 to #9 in the district, out of 11 stores.  The district managers were scrambling to recover, a few got demoted because of how things panned out, and the extreme higher-ups were not happy that the district was in such a state.  I laughed the laugh of the vindicated.

**TL;DR** - Quit the Evil Empire, people got fired or demoted because of it, and I had a good belly laugh over it.

**EDIT:**  Jesus Christ, Mother Mary, Joseph, and all their dancing little midgets, I was NOT expecting this kind of a response, let alone someone sending me reddit gold!!  I have a big dumb grin over here.

And for those of you who work retail, take a chapter from my book.  Work hard, become indespensible.  Eitherthe company will be decent and reward you, or they'll be corporate douches and you can fuck them by quitting.  Stand up for yourself, you don't need to be treated like a machine or worse."
29429,,,,,166.0,"Barack Obama.

It was 2004 and the DNC was in Boston. I was working at a law firm a block away from Faneuil Hall where all the news stations set up their makeshift studios. 

After work, I walked through all the madness and started to walk toward the T (subway) at Haymarket. I decided to call a friend who lived nearby to see if he wanted to grab a beer before I went home, so I stopped directly in front of the Union Oyster House.

My friend said he'd be there in 10 minutes, and - as I was a smoker then - I light up a cigarette. There were all kinds of suits around (some kind of big shot dinner was going on in the restaurant), so I was just kind of people watching to waste time. 

A younger-looking guy (younger than the crowd he was with) comes up and asks if he could bum a smoke. ""Sure thing, but they're menthols,"" I said. Guy thanked me, I gave him one, and we just small-talked for a bit. A couple of puffs in, and some official-looking woman ran over to him and said it was time for him to go. He thanked me, took off, and that was it. While I was waiting, I noticed him talking to one of the TV news people. 

Fast forward to the next night. I'm watching the DNC stuff and notice the guy I'd had a smoke with on the screen. Giving the keynote.

tldr; Had a smoke with Obama. Had no idea who he was in 2004.

&gt;Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.” 2 This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. 
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;7 After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. 8 God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. 9 He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. 10 Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? 11 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” 
&gt;...
&gt;19 [James says]“It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. 20 Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. 
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;The apostles and elders, your brothers,
&gt;
&gt;To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia:
&gt;
&gt;Greetings.
&gt;
&gt;24 We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. 25 So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul— 26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. 28 It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: 29 You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things.
&gt;
&gt;Farewell.

Peter, Paul, and James were all in agreement that Gentile Christians were not under the Law, and you're not going to find a Christian who thinks that the three of them together aren't credible sources of doctrine."

""The crowd turns on Kenny.  At the end of the rally a black man named Kenny walked through the crowd, and was immediately mistaken for being Muslim.  They mistook the Under-Armour head cap he was wearing as the Muslim skull cap, and as he walked through the crowd several people confronted him.  Ultimately he was asked to leave by security. 

After this I caught up with him and had a long conversation about how scary that was for him. He works at Ground Zero as a union carpenter. The hate at this rally was palpable. This is what scares me about the direction America is taking. I really got a good taste of the mob mentality at work.""

1) There is no real negative stigma attached to going outside wearing pyjamas in Shanghai, if you're just going out for a walk or to pick up a few bits of food. During the colder months you see plenty of middle-aged Chinese people wandering around in [awesome padded pyjamas](http://blog.foolsmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Shanghai-Pajamas-216x300.jpg), during the summer they're usually just in standard flannel numbers.

2) In fact, if anything there is a positive social stigma attached to pyjamas in Shanghai. Shanghai has always been an important port city, and pyjamas are certainly not a Chinese thing. Back in the day, if you had pyjamas you were probably a pretty wealthy person since they were an imported item, and you would have paid a lot for them. Also, poor people wouldn't have been able to afford an entirely different outfit just for the sake of sleeping in, so that's another reason why they were a display of affluence. Even though pyjamas have now ingratiated themselves into day to day Shanghai life, they still have a little of that social stigma of wealth.

  Now, you have to understand that Chinese culture is all about displaying your wealth. If you're rich, you want other people to know about it. That's why everybody wants an iPhone/iPad, not because they're the best gadgets, but because they're the *most expensive*. That's why people buy the top of the range Range Rovers to drive around Shanghai - a city without any hills. There is absolutely no point in being rich in China if you're not going to rub it in the nose of every Wang, Li and Zhang in your immediate vicinity.

  So, even though pyjamas no longer are *directly* linked with wealth, it's kind of a hangover from the time that they were, so if anything going outside in your pyjamas - something that would be met with ridicule and strange looks if I tried to do it back home - is certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

3) Let's face it, who can be bothered to get dressed up just to go and pick up some noodles or shengjianbao? Pyjamas are comfortable, especially the afore-mentioned padded sets, which are kind of like wearing a padded blanket.

Amusingly, back in 2010 when the World Expo was taking place in Shanghai, the Chinese government requested that Shanghainese people didn't wear their pyjamas outdoors, because they thought it would be seen by all the foreign visitors to be backwards and uncivilised. There were even 'pyjama police' on some streets who would tell residents to go back indoors and change into proper clothes. I think this is dumb, since there are plenty more bad street habits they should have been worrying about, rather than the rather cute 'issues' like wearing pyjamas outside - hawking/spitting in the street is rife here, along with not cleaning up your dog's shit (though this is slowly improving), and throwing litter on the street.

Personally, I think it's cool as hell. I often find myself saying ""你的睡衣很棒！"" (nǐ de shuìyī hěn bàng - your pyjamas are awesome) to random people on the street. My personal favourite is a lady who lives nearby, I see her a couple of times a week at around 7pm walking up the street in her pyjamas, walking her pets - a small dog and [a pig](http://www.flickr.com/photos/shanghaithere/6890691335/in/photostream) (who we've seen grow from a tiny piglet)."

OP flew the [EA-6B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA-6B_Prowler), whose job at the time I'd imagine was to provide a degree of EW(Electronic Warfare) jamming for the mission critical jet. This likely involved trying to prevent SAM ([Surface-to-Air-Missile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile)) target-seeking and fire control radars from achieving an effective 'lock-on' to the F-14. Also, if fired upon, he was probably authorized to attempt to destroy the SAM site that did the shooting. Likely with the [AGM-88](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-88_HARM), which is a pretty amazing piece of technology. Some trivia: 

""Magnum"" is spoken over the radio to announce the launch of an AGM-88.[5] During the Gulf War, if an aircraft was illuminated by enemy radar a bogus ""Magnum"" call on the radio was often enough to convince the operators to power down.[6] This technique would also be employed in Serbia during air operations in 1999.""

The [F-14 with TARPS pod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARPS) was the lead aircraft, and its mission was to photograph the battlespace, likely searching for evidence of recent military movement, war crimes (read: mass graves), etc. This was pretty much EXACTLY the premise of the [FA-18](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA-18) flights in 'Behind Enemy Lines'.

Triple A, or [Anti-Aircraft Artillery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Aircraft_Artillery) are essentially giant machine guns that try to shoot aircraft out of the sky. You've likely seen footage of them firing over Baghdad during the initial night raids of Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The 'oh lets stroke this alien snake despite the fact just five minutes ago in the movie we were so terrified of coming across an alien, we split off from the whole group, then when we somehow, inexplicably got lost despite the tunnels being mapped and being in constant contact with the ship. Then, we went in the complete opposite direction of a detected life form as the thought of ""checking it out"" was a big ""hell no""... oh... but now I see its only a mad hooded alien snake, I feel I better touch it' - douche.

Other points I dont really get (SPOILERS SPOILERS EVERYWHERE) :

* What exactly were the Engeineers running from in the original video hologram?

* In the video hologram, what happened to the ones that made it though the door and didnt get beheaded, if life in that chamber was able to be perfectly preserved?

* Why did nobody from the ship ever question David's movements despite the fact he was constantly wandering off by himself, to places nobody else has been yet on his little secret missions!??

* Why did nobody really have go at David for pressing buttons and opening doors before anything was really figured out yet?

* Why did the engineers in the first place, ever leave a star map for all of us, to a military complex in the first place? Even assuming they originally didnt want to kill us all, why would they point us to an attack planet, instead of a home world or at least a 'reception' world at least?

* Why was the Alien that came out of the Engineer an actual Alien, yet when Fairfield got one in the throat, he just became a super strong kinda deformed guy? Why no alien bursting through the stomach?

* What the the point of David poisoning that dude in the first place? He seemed like he was pretty sure what it would do to him, nothing came of it apart from the pregnancy, which, really, wouldnt have really solved anything even if she had given proper birth to it.

* Why did the one last engineer put himself in stasis? Why didnt they just come to our plaent 2000 years ago? If it was because of an outbreak as hinted at, then where was any evidence of that?

* ""Oh hey guys, we are picking up a life form"" - oh, you are picking up a life form on a planet that, you first thought, was holding alien life... this is surely something worth investigating. I mean, its obvious intelligent life was here at some point, maybe we can discover something he..oh...oh no wait... the readings gone again. Lets just assume without any other investigation what so ever that out multi billion dollar super floating scanners, lets just assume they were wrong... a glitch. They said there was life, but there is no life now... we shouldnt susspect anything. Total glitch.

* What was that opening scene all about? The engineer drinking that poison black death mixture?! It just rotted him away, yet turned everything and anything else into some form of angry killing organism. - Also, from what we saw, that black liquid stuff could pretty much destroy or infect anything (kinda like the Flood from Halo) - so why did that first engineer kill himself, why not just put the liquid in the water supply?

* Why would this super advanced race that created us, choose to wipe us out with a plague, which could so easily go wrong, and infect all of them... which, is I think they are hinting at what had happened, despite that never really being disclosed. - If they are so clever, why not laser the whole plaent into oblivion or something!?



Other things I didnt like:

* The characters were weak, I really couldnt care less about them... any of them.

* It kept on hinting that David was maybe kind of sentient, when he was called soul-less he looked a little sad. You got the impression he felt annoyed when people refered to him as just a machine thoughout the whole film... you kind of started to hope that he was going to be the character you could get behind... he may have something in common with us after all, we were, it would seem created, just as he was... maybe there is going to be a big point about how humanity and machine are not so different. Maybe the twist will be that he has been doing all these weird things for a good reason... perhaps this is the real character we are gonna get behind, out champion of the movie. Perhaps he..... oh... nope never mind. His heads gone. Lets just end that whole thing there then.

* Ok guys, we are going to make first contact with the last of an alien race, lets take our million year old totally frail almost completely dead mission founder along, lets not check out to see if the thing is friendly or hostile... I mean, nothing else has gone wrong so far.""

A load of other stuff aswell I cant be bothered to type... you get the idea though.

What an absolute crock. 

No matter how good the visuals or sound track is (even though there was no whhhHHHHRRRRRRrrrrhhhhhh WhhhhhHHHHHRRRRrrrrhhhhhh like the trailers which actually caught my attention evey time!) you cant get away with having so many open ended, totally unanswered, random unexplained questions, have so much totally ludicrous stuff go on, and offer no resolution to any of it what so ever.

I AM THE BEST FUCKING COMMANDER EVER."" ""YOU SEE THAT SHIT REAPERS? YOU SEE THAT SHIT I JUST DID? I'M COMING FOR YOU NEXT MOTHERFUCKERS."" And you get all hyped. Skip ahead 10 hours or so. You're running toward Harbinger. Dodging death beams. You feel like you're going to make it, you're so close to the big pay off. Then suddenly, you get shot with that death beam. Wtf? Did you just die? Is this game over? Wait wtf, how did your armor magically disappear?  And that's where it began. That was the fucking precise moment where nothing in mass effect would ever feel the same again. Then the kid. That fucking kid. Wait what? This CANNOT POSSIBLY be the ending. How could they possibly have looked at this ending and thought ""Yep, thats exactly how it should end. Never been more proud of an ending before in my whole life in fact."" Then you skip the credits hoping that maybe the big payoff could still come. LOL NOPE. ""And that, grandson, is the story of the character that suddenly didn't matter anymore 29 hours and 55 minutes into the game."" - Directed by M Night Shyamalan."

Are you and me talking about the same site here? My Reddit is populated with pictures of cats sitting on top or below cars, with content 3 days old from 4chan, with weird and wild accusations on how Dick Cheney is orchestrating internal militias.

Secondly, my post was flying high at +200 points until it got linked as being pushed by GOP operatives. 

On the insults part -- I was (maybe not so obviously) being self-deprecating. I've been a member here since nearly day one. But I'm not petulant enough to think that it's the core of the earth's being. It's a fucking online news site with javascript arrows."
