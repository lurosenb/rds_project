What makes this doubly infuriating is that this clown actually has the gall to blow the ""Obama has never had a job"" dogwhistle at every opportunity, including last night. Because apparently lawyer, professor, senator and *president of the goddamned United States* aren't jobs. News to me! Apparently we just elected some shiftless black guy president; shoot, I bet he's on welfare!

Meanwhile Romney and his faithful Fox News drones here at reddit keep touting his ""working man"" credentials from his time as a vulture capitalist. Quick, rightwingers: what did Romney actually **do** at Bain to earn his millions? What were his duties?

That pause you just experienced while you struggled to come up with an answer is the sound of something not being a *real* job.

That is, they would have cited US law, stating that sitting heads of state are immune from prosecution.  (At this point, Manuel Noriega might say, ""Oh, really?"")

Anyhow, Dubya's DoJ felt compelled to jump in with both feet before things went too far.  Atty. Gen. Keisler said allowing the case to go forward would be ""incompatible with the United States' foreign policy interests.""

&gt;No, we're just friends on Reddit. Apparently that's offended a lot of people.

No one's said they dislike you for having friends in this thread.  This is just deflection by putting words in peoples' mouths.


Or we could talk about all of your lame excuses about how you ""don't care about karma"".


The only way you've been serious in this entire thread is if you're *actually* delusional.

EDIT:  So can you be done now?  You've spent 4+ hours in this thread babbling like a mad man.  And before you accuse me of having no life as well (as you guys always do) I will assure you that I've eaten dinner and been playing Mega Man X which you've been rudely interrupting.
